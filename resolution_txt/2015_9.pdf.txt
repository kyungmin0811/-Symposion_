Everybody has moments of doubt about something or other from time to time; it is a natural process.
The challenge is not to let those moments accumulate and affect your selfbelief.
You will always face the challenge of other people’s comments and opinion.
There are people that you feel good being around and others you don’t.
Some people give you positive energy because they believe in you.
You feel it and you rise to the occasion.
Others may always have a negative comment to make about what you are doing or talking about.
Don’t let these comments rock your selfbelief.
Always question the person’s reason for the comment.
If it is based on fact, you should listen; if not, then it is only their opinion.
You will need to stay strong.

Delia stepped out of the front door of her house, and the day welcomed her with a warm and sunny smile.
With each step, she thought, “I can’t wait for today’s class.” Her family had recently moved into the neighborhood, and the new school year had just begun at Elanova High School.
Her new school offered ballet lessons, and Delia eagerly signed up.
She was one step closer to fulfilling her lifelong dream of becoming a ballerina.
Delia sat at the bench waiting for the school bus.
As the bus rolled down Madison Avenue, she slipped her hand into her ballet bag to touch her new shoes.
She thought about working hard on her leaps and jumps.
“I want to soar to the moon,” Delia thought.

One reason many people keep delaying things they should do is that they fear they will do them wrong or poorly, so they just don’t do them at all.
For example, one of the best ways to write a book is to write it as quickly as possible, getting your thoughts onto paper without regard to style.
Then, you can go back to revise and polish your writing.
If I only wrote when I knew it would be perfect, I’d still be working on my first book Do you have a hard time relaxing if your house is a mess Do you beat yourself up for making mistakes I’ve got a simple message for you today It’s time to let go of your perfectionism.
It becomes a stumbling block that keeps you stuck.

Textiles and clothing have functions that go beyond just protecting the body.
Dress and textiles alike are used as a means of nonverbal communication.
Obvious examples would be the use of uniforms to communicate a particular social role and the modern white wedding dress Western cultures use to mark this rite of passage.
Both types of clothing communicate important information nonverbally to the onlooker.
The female wearing the white dress is about to be married and change her status and role in society.
The person in the uniform has some specialized function in society, such as police officer, nurse, or soldier.
Therefore, it can be said that clothing visually communicates information about group membership and functions as an identity marker.

Traditional consumption was not particularly thrifty.
The concept of thrift emerged out of a more affluent money culture.
In traditional societies where resources continued to be scarce, consumption was more seasonally and communally orientated.
In years of bountiful crops people ate heartily, and in lean years they starved.
People were not particularly motivated to produce more goods for stockpiling, as there was little incentive to do so where there was little security from raids.
When times were good, celebrations of gluttony were held in the winter season when stocks could not be refilled.
These rituals were more important than the potential hardships such celebrations might later bring, as they served to bind people together and distribute resources.
Holiday rituals were typically structured around cultural practices such as song, dance, theater, and feasting, and took a great deal of time away from work.

Living rock cactus is one of the most peculiar plants found in the desert.
For most of the year, it blends into the rocky limestone soils of the Dead Horse Mountains, Mariscal Mountain, and the hills along the Rio Grande.
You may step on one before you notice it.
Spineless and flat against the ground, it has triangular tubercles that overlap in a starshaped pattern.
In extremely dry conditions, living rock cactus is almost invisible it literally shrinks into the surrounding rocky soil.
Moisture is stored in the root, and during droughts the root shrinks, dragging the stem underground.
These spineless plants survive by blending into their native habitat.
As added protection, they store foultasting, poisonous alkaloids in their bodies.

The term objectivity is important in measurement because of the scientific demand that observations be subject to public verification.
A measurement system is objective to the extent that two observers (A) evaluate  evaluating the same performance arrive at the same (or very similar) measurements.
For example, using a tape measure to determine the distance a javelin (B) threw  was thrown yields very similar results regardless of who reads the tape.
By comparison, evaluation of performances such as diving, gymnastics, and figure skating is more subjective  although elaborate scoring rules help make (C) it  them more objective.
From the point of view of research in motor behavior, it is important to use performances in the laboratory for which the scoring can be as objective as possible.

A special feature of the real estate rental market is its tendency to undergo a severe and prolonged contraction phase, more so than with manufactured products.
When the supply of a manufactured product exceeds the demand, the manufacturer cuts back on output, and the merchant reduces inventory to balance supply and demand.
However, property owners cannot reduce the amount of space available for rent in their buildings.
Space that was constructed to accommodate business and consumer needs at the peak of the cycle remains, so vacancy rates climb and the downward trend becomes more severe.
Rental rates generally do not drop below a certain point, the maximum that must be charged in order to cover operating expenses.
Some owners will take space off the market rather than lose money on it.
A few, unable to subsidize the property, will sell at distress prices, and lenders will repossess others.
These may then be placed on the market at lower rental rates, further depressing the market.

We’ve all heard the phrase “the family that plays together, stays together.” The wisdom in this phrase is that social play builds ties between people that are lasting and consequential.
(A) In crying out, the dangerspotting squirrel draws attention to itself, which may well attract the predator.
Scientists used to think that animals would risk their lives like this only for kin with whom they shared common genes.
(B) This wisdom holds outside the human family circle as well.
For example, when one ground squirrel sees a predator in the distance, it will sound an alarm call that alerts other squirrels to run for cover.
It’s a risky move.(C) New evidence suggests, however, that squirrels also sound alarm calls for former playmates, not genetically related.
These squirrels developed a social resource while playing ― and these buddies will put their lives on the line to save their playmates.

Selffulfilling prophecies can have a positive side.
( ) We know that students introduced to their teachers as “intellectual bloomers” often do better on achievement tests than do their counterparts who lack such a positive introduction.
( ) In a study of army tank crews, one set of tank commanders was told that some members of their assigned crews had exceptional abilities while others were only average.
( ) In reality, the crew members had been assigned randomly so that the two test groups were equal in ability.
( ) The commanders later reported that the socalled “exceptional” crew members performed better than the “average” ones.
( ) The selffulfilling effects in these cases strongly suggest that managers adopt positive and optimistic approaches toward others at work.

Studies do show that motorists are more likely to yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks than at unmarked crosswalks.
But as some researchers found, that does not necessarily make things safer.
( ) When they compared the way pedestrians crossed at both kinds of crosswalks on roads with considerable traffic volumes, they found that people at unmarked crosswalks tended to look both ways more often, waited more often for gaps in traffic, and crossed the road more quickly.
( ) Researchers suspect that both drivers and pedestrians are more aware that drivers should yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks.
( ) Not knowing traffic safety laws, it turns out, is actually a good thing for pedestrians.
( ) Because they do not know whether cars are supposed to stop, they act more cautiously.
( ) Marked crosswalks, by contrast, may give pedestrians an unrealistic picture of their own safety.

Some researchers investigated the effects of different media on children’s ability to produce imaginative responses.
In one study, children in grades one through four were separated randomly into two groups and presented with the same fictional story.
One group listened to the story via radio, while the other group watched the story on a television.
Afterward, all of the children were asked what they thought would happen next in the story.
The researchers rated children’s imaginativeness by recording the novel elements (such as characters, setting, dialogue, and feelings) they used in their responses.
Some novelists prefer to include as many characters as possible in their stories.
The children who listened to the radio produced more imaginative responses, whereas the children who watched the television produced more words that repeated the original story.
Media scholars have used this study to illustrate the “visualization hypothesis,” which states that children’s exposure to readymade visual images restricts their ability to generate novel images of their own..
One of the many strengths of the African American community is an intrinsic support for the athletic endeavors of African American girls and women.
Since African American culture appreciates a greater flexibility of gender roles and accepts a broader range of genderappropriate behaviors, African American women are not as bound as white women by gender role stereotypes.
Athletics for girls and women is not perceived as conflicting with an African American female’s gender role.
Hall and Bower’s study of African American females found that African American women defined themselves as “softly strong” ― owning both strength and femininity without conflict.
African American males have played an increasingly important role in global politics.
Welcome support from the African American community has energized many African American girls and women to participate in sports.

Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits the mind by catching the reader’s attention and triggering moments of selfreflection.
The brain activity of volunteers was monitored as they read classical works.
These same texts were then “translated” into more straightforward, modern language and again the readers’ brains were monitored as they read the words.
Scans showed that the more challenging prose and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions.
Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structures.
This lighting up lasts long enough to shift the brain into a higher gear, encouraging further reading.
The research also found that reading the more challenging version of poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences in light of what they have read.
The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than selfhelp books.Original versions of classical texts are helpful to readers because they contain (A) language that inspires further reading and (B) readers’ selfreflection.(A)(B)

Organisms must compete for resources not only with members of their own species, but with members of other species.
When two species use the same resource and the resource is scarce, the species must compete just as if they were members of the same population.
One of the two species usually turns out to be better at the competition.
If two species eat exactly the same food, for example, one of the two will be better at catching it.
Unless something interferes, the inferior competitor loses out and the competitively superior species takes over.
When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it, it is called competitive exclusion.Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented from excluding poorer competitors.
Periodic disturbances such as severe storms, battering by drifting logs, or underwater landslides can reduce the population of a dominant competitor and give other species a chance.
Furthermore, which species is competitively superior sometimes depends on the conditions.
On rocky shores in tropical Hong Kong, for example, foliose (leaflike) algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively cool winter.
In the summer heat, these forms die out and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae.
Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from excluding the other, and there is a  between the competing species.
