“Daddy” Jenny called, waving a yellow crayon in her little hand.
Nathan approached her, wondering why she was calling him.
Jenny, his threeyearold toddler, was drawing a big circle on a piece of paper.
“What are you doing, Sweetie” Nathan asked with interest.
She just kept drawing without reply.
He continued watching her, wondering what she was working on.
She was drawing something that looked like a face.
When she finished it, Jenny shouted, “Look, Daddy” She held her artwork up proudly.
Taking a closer look, Nathan recognized that it was his face.
The face had two big eyes and a beard just like his.
He loved Jenny’s work.
Filled with joy and happiness, Nathan gave her a big hug.

Becoming competent in another culture means looking beyond behavior to see if we can understand the attitudes, beliefs, and values that motivate what we observe.
By looking only at the visible aspects of culture ― customs, clothing, food, and language ― we develop a shortsighted view of intercultural understanding ― just the tip of the iceberg, really.
If we are to be successful in our business interactions with people who have different values and beliefs about how the world is ordered, then we must go below the surface of what it means to understand culture and attempt to see what Edward Hall calls the “hidden dimensions.” Those hidden aspects are the very foundation of culture and are the reason why culture is actually more than meets the eye.
We tend not to notice those cultural norms until they violate what we consider to be common sense, good judgment, or the nature of things.

You may feel there is something scary about an algorithm deciding what you might like.
Could it mean that, if computers conclude you won’t like something, you will never get the chance to see it Personally, I really enjoy being directed toward new music that I might not have found by myself.
I can quickly get stuck in a rut where I put on the same songs over and over.
That’s why I’ve always enjoyed the radio.
But the algorithms that are now pushing and pulling me through the music library are perfectly suited to finding gems that I’ll like.
My worry originally about such algorithms was that they might drive everyone into certain parts of the library, leaving others lacking listeners.
Would they cause a convergence of tastes But thanks to the nonlinear and chaotic mathematics usually behind them, this doesn’t happen.
A small divergence in my likes compared to yours can send us off into different far corners of the library.

Historically, drafters of tax legislation are attentive to questions of economics and history, and less attentive to moral questions.
Questions of morality are often pushed to the side in legislative debate, labeled too controversial, too difficult to answer, or, worst of all, irrelevant to the project.
But, in fact, the moral questions of taxation are at the very heart of the creation of tax laws.
Rather than irrelevant, moral questions are fundamental to the imposition of tax.
Tax is the application of a society’s theories of distributive justice.
Economics can go a long way towards helping a legislature determine whether or not a particular tax law will help achieve a particular goal, but economics cannot, in a vacuum, identify the goal.
Creating tax policy requires identifying a moral goal, which is a task that must involve ethics and moral analysis.

Environmental learning occurs when farmers base decisions on observations of “payoff” information.
They may observe their own or neighbors’ farms, but it is the empirical results they are using as a guide, not the neighbors themselves.
They are looking at farming activities as experiments and assessing such factors as relative advantage, compatibility with existing resources, difficulty of use, and “trialability” ― how well can it be experimented with.
But that criterion of “trialability” turns out to be a real problem; it’s true that farmers are always experimenting, but working farms are very flawed laboratories.
Farmers cannot set up the controlled conditions of professional test plots in research facilities.
Farmers also often confront complex and difficulttoobserve phenomena that would be hard to manage even if they could run controlled experiments.
Moreover farmers can rarely acquire payoff information on more than a few of the production methods they might use, which makes the criterion of “relative advantage” hard to measure.

Not only musicians and psychologists, but also committed music enthusiasts and experts often voice the opinion that the beauty of music lies in an expressive deviation from the exactly defined score.
Concert performances become interesting and gain in attraction from the fact that they go far beyond the information printed in the score.
In his early studies on musical performance, Carl Seashore discovered that musicians only rarely play two equal notes in exactly the same way.
Within the same metric structure, there is a wide potential of variations in tempo, volume, tonal quality and intonation.
Such variation is based on the composition but diverges from it individually.
We generally call this ‘expressivity’.
This explains why we do not lose interest when we hear different artists perform the same piece of music.
It also explains why it is worthwhile for following generations to repeat the same repertoire.
New, inspiring interpretations help us to expand our understanding, which serves to enrich and animate the music scene.

Leon Festinger was an American social psychologist.
He was born in New York City in  to a Russian immigrant family.
As a graduate student at the University of Iowa, Festinger was influenced by Kurt Lewin, a leading social psychologist.
After graduating from there, he became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in .
He later moved to Stanford University, where he continued his work in social psychology.
His theory of social comparison earned him a good reputation.
Festinger actively participated in international scholarly cooperation.
In the late s, he turned his interest to the field of history.
He was one of the most cited psychologists of the twentieth century.
Festinger’s theories still play an important role in psychology today.

Recognizing ethical issues is the most important step in understanding business ethics.
An ethical issue is an identifiable problem, situation, or opportunity that requires a person to choose from among several actions that may be evaluated as right or wrong, ethical or unethical.
Learn how to choose from alternatives and make a decision requires not only good personal values, but also knowledge competence in the business area of concern.
Employees also need to know when to rely on their organizations’ policies and codes of ethics or have discussions with coworkers or managers on appropriate conduct.
Ethical decision making is not always easy because there are always gray areas that create dilemmas, no matter how decisions are made.
For instance, should an employee report on a coworker engaging in time theft Should a salesperson leave out facts about a product’s poor safety record in his presentation to a customer Such questions require the decision maker to evaluate the ethics of his or her choice and decide whether to ask for guidance.

Although the wonders of modern technology have provided people with opportunities beyond the wildest dreams of our ancestors, the good, as usual, is weakened by a downside.
One of those downsides is that anyone who so chooses can pick up the virtual megaphone that is the Internet and put in their two cents on any of an infinite number of topics, regardless of their qualifications.
After all, on the Internet, there are no regulations preventing a kindergarten teacher from offering medical advice or a physician from suggesting ways to safely make structural changes to your home.
As a result, misinformation gets disseminated as information, and it is not always easy todifferentiate the two.
This can be particularly frustrating for scientists, who spend their lives learning how to understand the intricacies of the world around them, only to have their work summarily challenged by people whose experience with the topic can be measured in minutes.
This frustration is then diminished by the fact that, to the general public, both the scientist and the challenger are awarded equal credibility.

More than just having territories, animals also partition them.
And this insight turned out to be particularly useful for zoo husbandry.
An animal’s territory has an internal arrangement that Heini Hediger compared to the inside of a person’s house.
Most of us assign separate functions to separate rooms, but even if you look at a oneroom house you will find the same internal specialization.
In a cabin or a mud hut, or even a Mesolithic cave from , years ago, this part is for cooking, that part is for sleeping; this part is for making tools and weaving, that part is for waste.
We keep .
To a varying extent, other animals do the same.
A part of an animal’s territory is for eating, a part for sleeping, a part for swimming or wallowing, a part may be set aside for waste, depending on the species of animal.

Because plants tend to recover from disasters more quickly than animals, they are essential to the revitalization of damaged environments.
Why do plants have this preferential ability to recover from disaster It is largely because, unlike animals, they can generate new organs and tissues throughout their life cycle.
This ability is due to the activity of plant meristems ― regions of undifferentiated tissue in roots and shoots that can, in response to specific cues, differentiate into new tissues and organs.
If meristems are not damaged during disasters, plants can recover and ultimately transform the destroyed or barren environment.
You can see this phenomenon on a smaller scale when a tree struck by lightning forms new branches that grow from the old scar.
In the form of forests and grasslands, plants regulate the cycling of water and adjust the chemical composition of the atmosphere.
In addition to regeneration or resprouting of plants, disturbed areas can also recover through reseeding.

.When two natural bodies of water stand at different levels, building a canal between them presents a complicated engineering problem.
(A) Then the upper gates open and the ship passes through.
For downstream passage, the process works the opposite way.
The ship enters the lock from the upper level, and water is pumped from the lock until the ship is in line with the lower level.(B) When a vessel is going upstream, the upper gates stay closed as the ship enters the lock at the lower water level.
The downstream gates are then closed and more water is pumped into the basin.
The rising water lifts the vessel to the level of the upper body of water.(C) To make up for the difference in level, engineers build one or more water “steps,” called locks, that carry ships or boats up or down between the two levels.
A lock is an artificial water basin.
It has a long rectangular shape with concrete walls and a pair of gates at each end.

.In particular, they define a group as two or more people who interact with, and exert mutual influences on, each other.In everyday life, we tend to see any collection of people as a group.
( ) However, social psychologists use this term more precisely.
( ) It is this sense of mutual interaction or interdependence for a common purpose which distinguishes the members of a group from a mere aggregation of individuals.
( ) For example, as Kenneth Hodge observed, a collection of people who happen to go for a swim after work on the same day each week does not, strictly speaking, constitute a group because these swimmers do not interact with each other in a structured manner.
( ) By contrast, a squad of young competitive swimmers who train every morning before going to school is a group because they not only share a common objective (training for competition) but also interact with each other in formal ways (e.g., by warming up together beforehand).
( ) It is this sense of people coming together to achieve a common objective that defines a “team”.

A striving to demonstrate individual personality through designs should not be surprising.
Most designers are educated to work as individuals, and design literature contains countless references to ‘the designer’.
Personal flair is without doubt an absolute necessity in some product categories, particularly relatively small objects, with a low degree of technological complexity, such as furniture, lighting, small appliances, and housewares.
In largerscale projects, however, even where a strong personality exercises powerful influence, the fact that substantial numbers of designers are employed in implementing a concept can easily be overlooked.
The emphasis on individuality is therefore problematic ― rather than actually designing, many successful designer ‘personalities’ function more as creative managers.
A distinction needs to be made between designers working truly alone and those working in a group.
In the latter case, management organization and processes can be equally as relevant as designers’ creativity.

Climate change experts and environmental humanists alike agree that the climate crisis is, at its core, a crisis of the imagination and much of the popular imagination is shaped by fiction.
In his  book The Great Derangement, anthropologist and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between imagination and environmental management, arguing that humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part because fiction (a) fails to believably represent it.
Ghosh explains that climate change is largely absent from contemporary fiction because the cyclones, floods, and other catastrophes it brings to mind simply seem too “improbable” to belong in stories about everyday life.
But climate change does not only reveal itself as a series of (b) extraordinary events.
In fact, as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out, environmental change can be “imperceptible”; it proceeds (c) rapidly, only occasionally producing “explosive and spectacular” events.
Most climate change impacts cannot be observed daytoday, but they become (d) visible when we are confronted with their accumulated impacts.Climate change evades our imagination because it poses significant representational challenges.
It cannot be observed in “human time,” which is why documentary filmmaker Jeff Orlowski, who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and coral reefs, uses “before and after” photographs taken several months apart in the same place to (e) highlight changes that occurred gradually.

(A)Walking out of Charing Cross Station in London, Emilia and her traveling companion, Layla, already felt their hearts pounding.
It was the second day of their European summer trip.
They were about to visit one of the world’s most famous art galleries.
The two of them started hurrying with excitement.
Suddenly, Emilia shouted, “Look There it is We’re finally at the National Gallery” Layla laughed and responded, “(a) Your dream’s finally come true”(B)“Don’t lose hope yet Which gallery is the special exhibition at” Layla asked.
Emilia responded, “Well, his Sunflowers is still in England, but it’s at a gallery in Liverpool.
That’s a long way, isn’t it” After a quick search on her phone, Layla stated, “No It’s only two hours to Liverpool by train.
The next train leaves in an hour.
Why don’t we take it” After considering the idea, Emilia, now relieved, responded, “Yeah, but (b) you always wanted to see Rembrandt’s paintings.
Let’s do that first, Layla Then, after lunch, we can catch the next train.” Layla smiled brightly.(C)However, after searching all the exhibition rooms, Emilia and Layla couldn’t find van Gogh’s masterpiece anywhere.
“That’s weird.
Van Gogh’s Sunflowers should be here.
Where is it” Emilia looked upset, but Layla kept calm and said, “Maybe (c) you’ve missed a notice about it.
Check the National Gallery app.” Emilia checked it quickly.
Then, she sighed, “Sunflowers isn’t here It’s been lent to a different gallery for a special exhibition.
(d) I can’t believe I didn’t check”(D)Upon entering the National Gallery, Emilia knew exactly where to go first.
(e) She grabbed Layla’s hand and dragged her hurriedly to find van Gogh’s Sunflowers.
It was Emilia’s favorite painting and had inspired her to become a painter.
Emilia loved his use of bright colors and light.
She couldn’t wait to finally see his masterpiece in person.
“It’ll be amazing to see how he communicated the feelings of isolation and loneliness in his work,” she said eagerly.
