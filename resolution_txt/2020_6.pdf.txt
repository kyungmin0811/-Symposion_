It was two hours before the paper submission.
With the deadline close at hand, Claire was still struggling with her writing.
Pressed for time and stuck in a deadlock, she had no idea how to finish the paper.
She wasn’t even sure whether she could submit it on time.
What she found in her paper was scribbled words, half sentences, and a pile of seemingly strange and disjointed ideas.
“Nothing makes sense,” she said to herself.
She looked at her writing and began reading it over and over.
All of a sudden and unexpectedly, something was found in that pile of thoughts the flow and connection of ideas she had not considered while she was writing.
From this moment, the ticking of the clock sounded encouraging to her.
“Yes, I can do it” Claire said as she grabbed her pencil again.

Learning a certain concept such as “molecules” requires more than just a single exposure to the idea.
If a student is going to remember a science concept, he or she should experience it multiple times and in various contexts.
That is one of the strengths of the learning cycle the students have direct experience with the concept, then they talk about it, and then they have even more direct experience.
Reading, watching videos, and listening to others’ thoughts contribute to a more solid understanding of the concept.
This suggests more than repetition.
Each event allows the student to examine the concept from a different perspective.
Ultimately this will lead to a substantive, useful understanding of the complexities and nuances of the concept.

Many companies confuse activities and results.
As a consequence, they make the mistake of designing a process that sets out milestones in the form of activities that must be carried out during the sales cycle.
Salespeople have a genius for doing what’s compensated rather than what’s effective.
If your process has an activity such as “submit proposal” or “make cold call,” then that’s just what your people will do.
No matter that the calls were to the wrong customer or went nowhere.
No matter that the proposal wasn’t submitted at the right point in the buying decision or contained inappropriate information.
The process asked for activity, and activity was what it got.
Salespeople have done what was asked for.
“Garbage in, garbage out” they will delight in telling you.
“It’s not our problem, it’s this dumb process.”

The twentyfirst century is the age of information and knowledge.
It is a century that is characterized by knowledge as the important resource that gains competitive advantage for companies.
To acquire all these knowledge and information, organizations must rely on the data that they store.
Data, the basic element, is gathered daily from different input sources.
Information is extracted or learned from these sources of data, and this captured information is then transformed into knowledge that is eventually used to trigger actions or decisions.
By and large, organizations do not have any problem of not having enough data because most organizations are rich with data.
The problem however is that many organizations are poor in information and knowledge.
This fact translates into one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations how to transform raw data into information and eventually into knowledge, which if exploited correctly provides the capabilities to predict customers’ behaviour and business trends.

In the twelfth to thirteenth centuries there appeared the first manuals teaching “table manners” to the offspring of aristocrats.
It was a genre that subsequently had a great success in the early modern period with The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione, The Galateo by Monsignor Della Casa, and many others produced in different European countries.
In a variety of ways and meanings, these are all instruments intended to define or distinguish who is in from who is out, separating the participants from the ostracized.
It is for this reason that manuals of “good manners” addressed to the aristocracy always have a negative reference to the peasant who behaves badly, who “doesn’t know” what the rules are, and for this reason is excluded from the lordly table.
Food etiquette had become a sign of social barriers and of the impossibility of breaking them down.

Racial and ethnic relations in the United States are better today than in the past, but many changes are needed before sports are a model of inclusion and fairness.
The challenges today are different from the ones faced twenty years ago, and experience shows that when current challenges are met, a new social situation is created in which new challenges emerge.
For example, once racial and ethnic segregation is eliminated and people come together, they must learn to live, work, and play with each other despite diverse experiences and cultural perspectives.
Meeting this challenge requires a commitment to equal treatment, plus learning about the perspectives of others, understanding how they define and give meaning to the world, and then determining how to form and maintain relationships while respecting differences, making compromises, and supporting one another in the pursuit of goals that may not always be shared.
None of this is easy, and challenges are never met once and for all time.

Along the coast of British Columbia lies a land of forest green and sparkling blue.
This land is the Great Bear Rainforest, which measures .
million hectares ― about the size of Ireland or Nova Scotia.
It is home to a wide variety of wildlife.
One of the unique animals living in the area is the Kermode bear.
It is a rare kind of bear known to be the official mammal of British Columbia.
Salmon are also found here.
They play a vital role in this area’s ecosystem as a wide range of animals, as well as humans, consume them.
The Great Bear Rainforest is also home to the Western Red Cedar, a tree that can live for several hundred years.
The tree’s wood is lightweight and rotresistant, so it is used for making buildings and furniture.

An interesting aspect of human psychology is that we tend to like things more and find them more appealing if everything about those things is not obvious the first time we experience them.
This is certainly true in music.
For example, we might hear a song on the radio for the first time that catches our interest and decide we like it.
Then the next time we hear it, we hear a lyric we didn’t catch the first time, or we might notice what the piano or drums are doing in the background.
A special harmony emerges that we missed before.
We hear more and more and understand more and more with each listening.
Sometimes, the longer that takes for a work of art to reveal all of its subtleties to us, the more fond of that thing ― whether it’s music, art, dance, or architecture ― we become.

Sometimes the awareness that one is distrusted can provide the necessary incentive for selfreflection.
An employee who realizes she isn’t being trusted by her coworkers with shared responsibilities at work might, upon reflection, identify areas where she has consistently let others down or failed to follow through on previous commitments.
Others’ distrust of her might then forbid her to perform her share of the duties in a way that makes her more worthy of their trust.
But distrust of one who is sincere in her efforts to be a trustworthy and dependable person can be disorienting and might cause her to doubt her own perceptions and to distrust herself.
Consider, for instance, a teenager whose parents are suspicious and distrustful when she goes out at night; even if she has been forthright about her plans and is not breaking any agreedupon rules, her identity as a respectable moral subject is undermined by a pervasive parental attitude that expects deceit and betrayal.

Some people have defined wildlife damage management as the science and management of overabundant species, but this definition is too narrow.
All wildlife species act in ways that harm human interests.
Thus, all species cause wildlife damage, not just overabundant ones.
One interesting example of this involves endangered peregrine falcons in California, which prey on another endangered species, the California least tern.
Certainly, we would not consider peregrine falcons as being overabundant, but we wish that they would not feed on an endangered species.
In this case, one of the negative values associated with a peregrine falcon population is that its predation reduces the population of another endangered species.
The goal of wildlife damage management in this case would be to stop the falcons from eating the terns without  the falcons.

When a dog is trained to detect drugs, explosives, contraband, or other items, the trainer doesn’t actually teach the dog how to smell; the dog already knows how to discriminate one scent from another.
Rather, the dog is trained to become emotionally aroused by one smell versus another.
In the stepbystep training process, the trainer attaches an “emotional charge” to a particular scent so that the dog is drawn to it above all others.
And then the dog is trained to search out the desired item on cue, so that the trainer can control or release the behavior.
This emotional arousal is also why playing tug with a dog is a more powerful emotional reward in a training regime than just giving a dog a food treat, since the trainer invests more emotion into a game of tug.
As long as the trainer gives the dog a food reward regularly, the dog can understand its “good” behavior results in rewards.
From a dog’s point of view, the tug toy is compelling because the trainer is “upset” by the toy.

.Notation was more than a practical method for preserving an expanding repertoire of music.
(A) Written notes freeze the music rather than allowing it to develop in the hands of individuals, and it discourages improvisation.
Partly because of notation, modern classical performance lacks the depth of nuance that is part of aural tradition.
Before notation arrived, in all history music was largely carried on as an aural tradition.
(B) It changed the nature of the art itself.
To write something down means that people far away in space and time can recreate it.
At the same time, there are downsides.
(C) Most world music is still basically aural, including sophisticated musical traditions such as Indian and Balinese.
Most jazz musicians can read music but often don’t bother, and their art is much involved with improvisation.
Many modern pop musicians, one example being Paul McCartney, can’t read music at all.

.Rather, happiness is often found in those moments we are most vulnerable, alone or in pain.
We seek out feelgood experiences, always on the lookout for the next holiday, purchase or culinary experience.
This approach to happiness is relatively recent; it depends on our capacity both to pad our lives with material pleasures and to feel that we can control our suffering.
( ) Painkillers, as we know them today, are a relatively recent invention and access to material comfort is now within reach of a much larger proportion of the world’s population.
( ) These technological and economic advances have had significant cultural implications, leading us to see our negative experiences as a problem and maximizing our positive experiences as the answer.
( ) Yet, through this we have forgotten that being happy in life is not just about pleasure.
( ) Comfort, contentment and satisfaction have never been the elixir of happiness.
( ) Happiness is there, on the edges of these experiences, and when we get a glimpse of that kind of happiness it is powerful, transcendent and compelling.

After the United Nations environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in  made the term “sustainability” widely known around the world, the word became a popular buzzword by those who wanted to be seen as proenvironmental but who did not really intend to change their behavior.
It became a public relations term, an attempt to be seen as abreast with the latest thinking of what we must do to save our planet from widespread harm.
But then, in a decade or so, some governments, industries, educational institutions, and organizations started to use the term in a serious manner.
In the United States a number of large corporations appointed a vice president for sustainability.
Not only were these officials interested in how their companies could profit by producing “green” products, but they were often given the task of making the company more efficient by reducing wastes and pollution and by reducing its carbon emissions.

Aristotle did not think that all human beings should be allowed to engage in political activity in his system, women, slaves, and foreigners were explicitly (a) excluded from the right to rule themselves and others.
Nevertheless, his basic idea that politics is a unique collective activity that is directed at certain (b) common goals and ends still resonates today.
But which ends Many thinkers and political figures since the ancient world have developed different ideas about the goals that politics can or should achieve.
This approach is known as political moralism.For moralists, political life is a branch of ethics ― or moral philosophy ― so it is (c) unsurprising that there are many philosophers in the group of moralistic political thinkers.
Political moralists argue that politics should be directed toward achieving substantial goals, or that political arrangements should be organized to (d) protect certain things.
Among these things are political values such as justice, equality, liberty, happiness, fraternity, or national selfdetermination.
At its most radical, moralism produces descriptions of ideal political societies known as Utopias, named after English statesman and philosopher Thomas More’s book Utopia, published in , which imagined an ideal nation.
Utopian political thinking dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato’s book the Republic, but it is still used by modern thinkers such as Robert Nozick to explore ideas.
Some theorists consider Utopian political thinking to be a (e) promising undertaking, since it has led in the past to justifications of totalitarian violence.
However, at its best, Utopian thinking is part of a process of striving toward a better society, and many thinkers use it to suggest values to be pursued or protected.

(A)When Master Brooks played a Mozart piece on the violin for his class to learn, the room was filled with waves of beautiful, soulstirring sound.
The class tried to emulate the music played by this renowned guest musician.
Among the students in the class, Joe Brooks was by far the best.
In fact, Joe was the master’s son.
His father had placed a baby violin in his hands at the age of four, and Joe was a natural talent.
Now, just twelve years later, he was already on (a) his way to becoming a virtuoso like his father.

“Wow, that was quite wonderful,” he said with admiration.
Master Brooks came toward his son.
“I love the way you created those unique sounds while keeping the spirit of the violin.
I underestimated the power that crossover music can create,” said Master Brooks to (b) him.
Joe and his father returned home, both humming the melody that the band had been practicing.(C)“Well, did you get permission” asked Brian as soon as Joe entered the practice room the following day.
“Um, I’m not sure,” answered Joe without confidence.
“(c) You can tell us about it after practice,” Brian said as he placed his fingers on the keyboard.
Beside him, Nick was tuning his guitar.
Joe thought that he would play just one last time before telling them that (d) he might pull out of the concert.
The trio swung into their routine, as easily as only a group that had practiced long and hard together could.(D)After the class, Joe was alone with his father.
He had something important to talk about.
Joe took a deep breath and said, “I have been asked to play in a concert, and I would like your permission first.
It is a crossover concert.” Master Brooks looked surprised.
Indeed, the master’s dislike of crossover music was no secret.
“Father,” Joe took a deep breath and continued, “I respect your views, but it is not what (e) you think.
Why don’t you come and listen to our practice tomorrow If you don’t like it, I will cancel.”
