On my first day in the Emergency Center, I was about to drink my coffee when the first call came.
I quickly picked up the line, “.” My voice was trembling and my heart was racing.
A woman cried, “My husband’s not breathing” I instructed her to begin CPR.
I was trying to be as steady as I could, but I was shaking.
The situation was absolutely critical.
While she was performing CPR, I immediately notified the nearby hospital.
After a few tense moments, she came back on the line and shouted, “Where’s the ambulance” I replied, “It’s getting there as quickly as it can.”

Merely having goals clearly defined is not sufficient, for one must also know, moment by moment, what precisely needs to be done.
For instance, a salesperson’s aim is to conclude a sale profitably.
However, each sale requires a different approach Should he be pushy or laid back, authoritative or friendly And what aspect of the product should he emphasize The answers to these questions depend on variables that cannot be predicted in advance.
This holds true not only for sales but also for most human activities.
One must select a particular strategy appropriate to the occasion and follow the chosen course of action.
Doing so will ensure more lasting success in reaching one’s goals.

There is strong research evidence that children perform better in mathematics if music is incorporated in it.
It has been shown that mathematics is related with music in various known ways so much that not putting the relationship to good use in and out of school could only be to our disadvantage.
Researchers at a Los Angeles school found that  second year elementary school pupils who learned to play the piano and read music improved their numeracy skills.
This could be so since learning music emphasizes thinking in space and time, and when pupils learn rhythm, they are learning ratios, fractions and proportions.
Other researchers investigated the ways in which first and third grade teachers could integrate music into their regular math classrooms.
They concluded that musicmath integrated lessons had positive effects on three mathematical ability areas of modeling, problem solving and application.

Do you have the emotional state of mind to become a leader People pay close attention to a leader’s subtle expressions of emotion through body language and facial expression.
Some emotions such as enthusiasm can quickly become contagious.
Others, such as depression or discouragement, can drag down the entire organization.
Leaders with positive emotional states of mind are like human magnets.
People naturally gravitate to them and want to follow them.
Such leaders inspire enthusiasm in their organizations and attract the best people to work for them.
Conversely, leaders who emit negative emotional states of mind, who are irritable and bossy, repel people and have few followers.

Effective coaches prioritize.
They focus on a single task instead of trying to multitask.
They understand that multitasking is another way of saying you are going to complete several tasks, none of which are going to be very good.
Yuhong Jiang, professor of psychology at Harvard University, points out that the brain isn’t built to concentrate on two things at once.
It works more slowly if it tries to.
Effective coaches focus on those things that need to get done and separate out everything else.
Separating what’s important from what’s not important is prioritizing.
Ineffective coaches fail to put the big tasks first.
They either believe they have unlimited time, thinking that they will have more time tomorrow to get something done, or they underestimate how much time they really do have.
They have no ability to estimate how long a task will take.

His talents were recognized early, and he was sent to Eton College by wealthy sponsors at .
Four years later, he entered Cambridge University.
He significantly improved Greek texts and edited four plays written by Euripides.
In , he was elected Principal Librarian at the newly founded London Institution.
During his lifetime, he collected a great many books on classical literature.
Although the number of books he owned in total is simply unknown, an episode about his passion for books is wellknown he carried so many books that he was able to pull book after book out of his pocket when a student tried to show off his knowledge of Greek writers.
Despite his fame as a classical scholar, he actually published little.
On September , , three months before reaching age , Porson died.

The Internet and communication technologies play an everincreasing role in the social lives of young people in developed societies.
Adolescents have been quick to immerse themselves in technology with most using the Internet to communicate.
Young people treat the mobile phone as an essential necessity of life and often prefer to use text messages to communicate with their friends.
Young people also increasingly access social networking websites.
As technology and the Internet are a familiar resource for young people, it is logical what they would seek assistance from this source.
This has been shown by the increase in websites that provide therapeutic information for young people.
A number of ‘youth friendly’ mental health websites have been developed.
The information presented often takes the form of Frequently Asked Questions, fact sheets and suggested links.
It would seem, therefore, logical to provide online counselling for young people.Looking for Swimming InstructorsThe Little Swimmers Program is now looking for swimming instructors.It is a summer vacation swimming program for children aged .It is a week program beginning on August .RequirementsOver  years of agePrevious experience in teaching childrenLifeguard and first aid certificationsApplicants should download the application form from the website at www.littleswimmersclub.com.

An Egyptian executive, after entertaining his Canadian guest, offered him joint partnership in a new business venture.
The Canadian, delighted with the offer, suggested that they meet again the next morning with their respective lawyers to finalize the details.
The Egyptian never showed up.
The surprised and disappointed Canadian tried to understand what had gone wrong Did Egyptians lack punctuality Was the Egyptian expecting a counteroffer Were lawyers unavailable in Cairo None of these explanations proved to be correct; rather, the problem was caused by the different meaning Canadians and Egyptians attach to inviting lawyers.
The Canadian regarded the lawyers’ absence as facilitating the successful completion of the negotiation; the Egyptian interpreted it as signaling the Canadian’s mistrust of his verbal commitment.
Canadians often use the impersonal formality of a lawyer’s services to finalize agreements.
Egyptians, by contrast, more frequently depend on the personal relationship between bargaining partners to accomplish the same purpose.

Early human societies were nomadic, based on hunting and gathering, and, in a shifting pattern of life in search of new sources of food, qualities such as lightness, portability, and adaptability were dominant criteria.
With the evolution of more settled rural societies based on agriculture, other characteristics, other traditions of form appropriate to the new patterns of life, rapidly emerged.
It must be emphasized, however, that tradition was not static, but constantly subject to minute variations appropriate to people and their circumstances.
Although traditional forms reflected the experience of social groups, specific manifestations could be adapted in various minute and subtle ways to suit individual users’ needs.
A chair could keep its basic, accepted characteristics while still being closely shaped in detail to the physique and proportions of a specific person.
This basic principle of  allowed a constant stream of incremental modifications to be introduced, which, if demonstrated by experience to be advantageous, could be integrated back into the mainstream of tradition.

Feedback is usually most effective when you offer it at the earliest opportunity, particularly if your objective is to teach someone a skill.
(A), if you are teaching your friend how to make your famous egg rolls, you provide a stepbystep commentary as you watch your pupil.
If he makes a mistake, you don’t wait until the egg rolls are finished to tell him that he left out the cabbage.
He needs immediate feedback to finish the rest of the sequence successfully.
Sometimes, (B), if a person is already sensitive and upset about something, delaying feedback can be wise.
Use your critical thinking skills to analyze when feedback will do the most good.
Rather than automatically offering immediate correction, use the justintime approach and provide feedback just before the person might make another mistake.(A)(B)

.If you walk into a store looking for a new computer and the first salesperson you meet immediately points to a group of computers and says, “Any of those are good,” and then walks away, there is a good chance you will walk away, too, and with good reason.(A) That is, the reader is the writer’s “customer” and one whose business or approval is one we need to seek.
The more you know about your reader, the greater the chances you will meet his or her needs and expectations.(B) Why You were never asked what you were seeking, how much you could spend, or if the computer would be used for business or pleasure or your child’s homework assignments.(C) In brief, the salesperson never considered or asked about your needs and preferences.
Just as it would come as no surprise to learn the salesperson who was indifferent to a potential customer’s needs was soon out of a job, the same holds true for writers who ignore their readers.

( ) The teacher recalls similar errors that some pupils made when doing addition problems by counting on along a number line.

( ) So the teacher reinforces this particular language pattern in subsequent oral work with the whole class..Still, many believe we will eventually reach a point at which conflict with the finite nature of resources is inevitable.Can we sustain our standard of living in the same ecological space while consuming the resources of that space This question is particularly relevant since we are living in an era of skyrocketing fuel costs and humans’ evergrowing carbon footprints.
( ) Some argue that we are already at a breaking point because we have nearly exhausted the Earth’s finite carrying capacity.
( ) However, it’s possible that innovations and cultural changes can expand Earth’s capacity.
( ) We are already seeing this as the world economies are increasingly looking at “green,” renewable industries like solar and hydrogen energy.
( ) That means survival could ultimately depend on getting the human population below its carrying capacity.
( ) Otherwise, without population control, the demand for resources will eventually exceed an ecosystem’s ability to provide it.

Scientific experiments should be designed to show that your hypothesis is wrong and should be conducted completely objectively with no possible subjective influence on the outcome.
Unfortunately few, if any, scientists are truly objective as they have often decided long before the experiment is begun what they would like the result to be.
This means that very often bias is (unintentionally) introduced into the experiment, the experimental procedure or the interpretation of results.
It is all too easy to justify to yourself why an experiment which does not fit with your expectations should be ignored, and why one which provides the results you ‘hoped for’ is the right one.
It is important to draw a meaningful result from the experiment on peer group activities.
This can be partly avoided by conducting experiments ‘blinded’ and by asking others to check your data or repeat experiments.

Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of their ecosystem than others.
Such species, called keystone species, are vital in determining the nature and structure of the entire ecosystem.
The fact that other species depend on or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed when the keystone species is removed.
It is in this sense that we should draw attention to fig trees.
Different species of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain forests.
Although figs collectively produce a continuous crop of fruits, fruiteating monkeys, birds, bats, and other vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large quantities of figs in their diets.
During the time of year when other fruits are less plentiful, however, fig trees become important in sustaining fruiteating vertebrates.
Should the fig trees disappear, most of the fruiteating vertebrates would be eliminated.
Protecting fig trees in such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that monkeys, birds, bats, and other vertebrates will survive.

True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of context.
The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is a telling example.
At the zoo, visitors may witness a great beast pacing behind the bars of its cage.
They may observe and admire the creature, its amazing bone structure, and its magnificent coat.
However, no matter how long visitors spend in front of that cage, they will never truly understand the beast.
True understanding can only come from seeing the creature in its natural surroundings and, in turn, the ways in which its presence affects its environment.
What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true of science.
To fully understand science, it must be considered within the society in which it functions.
Science is not conducted in a .
It is embedded within a social fabric, and just as a fleshandblood beast influences and is influenced by its environment, so too do science and society mutually influence one another.
Society, through ethical and economic constraints, exerts a powerful influence on what science accomplishes.
At the same time, the results of science have profound, and sometimes unexpected, impacts on every human being on earth.
Therefore, to make sense of sciencerelated issues, it is critical to recognize the bidirectional relationship between science and society.
