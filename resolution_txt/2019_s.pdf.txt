The waves were perfect for surfing.
 Dave, however, just could not stay on his board.
 He had tried more than ten times to stand up but never managed it.
 He felt that he would never succeed.
 He was about to give up when he looked at the sea one last time.
 The swelling waves seemed to say, Come on, Dave.
 One more try Taking a deep breath, he picked up his board and ran into the water.
 He waited for the right wave.
 Finally, it came.
 He jumped up onto the board just like he had practiced.
 And this time, standing upright, he battled the wave all the way back to shore.

War is inconceivable without some image, or concept, of the enemy.
 It is the presence of the enemy that gives meaning and justification to war.
 War follows from feelings of hatred, wrote Carl Schmitt.
 War has its own strategic, tactical, and other rules and points of view, but they all presuppose that the political decision has already been made as to who the enemy is.
 The concept of the enemy is fundamental to the moral assessment of war The basic aim of a nation at war in establishing an image of the enemy is to distinguish as sharply as possible the act of killing from the act of murder.
 However, we need to be cautious about thinking of war and the image of the enemy that informs it in an abstract and uniform way.
 Rather, both must be seen for the cultural and contingent phenomena that they are.

Dear Mr.
 Reese,A few days ago, I submitted my application and recipe for the nd Annual DC Metro Cooking Contest.
 However, I would like to change my recipe if it is possible.
 I have checked the website again, but I could only find information about the contest date, time, and prizes.
 I couldnt see any information about changing recipes.
 I have just created a great new recipe, and I believe people will love this more than the one I have already submitted.
 Please let me know if I can change my submitted recipe.
 I look forward to your response.

   refining ignorance       .
Although not the explicit goal, the best science can really be seen as refining ignorance.
 Scientists, especially young ones, can get too obsessed with results.
 Society helps them along in this mad chase.
 Big discoveries are covered in the press, show up on the universitys home page, help get grants, and make the case for promotions.
 But its wrong.
 Great scientists, the pioneers that we admire, are not concerned with results but with the next questions.
 The highly respected physicist Enrico Fermi told his students that an experiment that successfully proves a hypothesis is a measurement one that doesnt is a discovery.
 A discovery, an uncovering  of new ignorance.
 The Nobel Prize, the pinnacle of scientific accomplishment, is awarded, not for a lifetime of scientific achievement, but for a single discovery, a result.
 Even the Nobel committee realizes in some way that this is not really in the scientific spirit, and their award citations commonly honor the discovery for having opened a field up, transformed a field, or taken a field in new and unexpected directions.

With the industrial society evolving into an informationbased society, the concept of information as a product, a commodity with its own value, has emerged.
 As a consequence, those people, organizations, and countries that possess the highestquality information are likely to prosper economically, socially, and politically.
 Investigations into the economics of information encompass a variety of categories including the costs of information and information services the effects of information on decision making the savings from effective information acquisition the effects of information on productivity and the effects of specific agencies such as corporate, technical, or medical libraries on the productivity of organizations.
 Obviously many of these areas overlap, but it is clear that information has taken on a life of its own outside the medium in which it is contained.
 Information has become a recognized entity to be measured, evaluated, and priced.

 We argue that the ethical principles of justice provide an essential foundation for policies to protect unborn generations and the poorest countries from climate change.
 Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries.
 Increasing aid for the worlds poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation.
 With  percent of carbon emissions from mostly tropical deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most costeffective forms of abatement.
 Perhaps the most costeffective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD  destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels.
 Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture.

A defining element of catastrophes is the magnitude of their harmful consequences.
 To help societies prevent or reduce damage from catastrophes, a huge amount of effort and technological sophistication are often employed to assess and communicate the size and scope of potential or actual losses.
 This effort assumes that people can understand the resulting numbers and act on them appropriately.
 However, recent behavioral research casts doubt on this fundamental assumption.
 Many people do not understand large numbers.
 Indeed, large numbers have been found to lack meaning and to be underestimated in decisions unless they convey affect feeling.
 This creates a paradox that rational models of decision making fail to represent.
 On the one hand, we respond strongly to aid a single individual in need.
 On the other hand, we often fail to prevent mass tragedies or take appropriate measures to reduce potential losses from natural disasters.

 Monumental is a word that comes very close to expressing the basic characteristic of Egyptian art.
 Never before and never since has the quality of monumentality been achieved as fully as it did in Egypt.
 The reason for this is not the external size and massiveness of their works, although the Egyptians admittedly achieved some amazing things in this respect.
 Many modern structures exceed those of Egypt in terms of purely physical size.
 But massiveness has nothing to do with monumentality.
 An Egyptian sculpture no bigger than a persons hand is more monumental than that gigantic pile of stones that constitutes the war memorial in Leipzig, for instance.
 Monumentality is not a matter of external weight, but of inner weight.
 This inner weight is the quality which Egyptian art possesses to such a degree that everything in it seems to be made of primeval stone, like a mountain range, even if it is only a few inches across or carved in wood.

Europes first Homo sapiens lived primarily on large game, particularly reindeer.
 Even under ideal circumstances, hunting these fast animals with spear or bow and arrow is an uncertain task.
 The reindeer, however, had a weakness that mankind would mercilessly exploit it swam poorly.
 While afloat, it is uniquely vulnerable, moving slowly with its antlers held high as it struggles to keep its nose above water.
 At some point, a Stone Age genius realized the enormous hunting advantage he would gain by being able to glide over the waters surface, and built the first boat.
 Once the laboriously overtaken and killed prey had been hauled aboard, getting its body back to the tribal camp would have been far easier by boat than on land.
 It would not have taken long for mankind to apply this advantage to other goods.

 Finkenauer and Rim investigated the memory of the unexpected death of Belgiums King Baudouin in  in a large sample of Belgian citizens.
 The data revealed that the news of the kings death had been widely socially shared.
 By talking about the event, people gradually constructed a social narrative and a collective memory of the emotional event.
 At the same time, they consolidated their own memory of the personal circumstances in which the event took place, an effect known as flashbulb memory.
 The more an event is socially shared, the more it will be fixed in peoples minds.
 Social sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural tendency people may have.
 Naturally, people should be driven to forget undesirable events.
 Thus, someone who just heard a piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened.

 Minorities tend not to have much power or status and may even be dismissed as troublemakers, extremists or simply weirdos.
 How, then, do they ever have any influence over the majority.
 The social psychologist Serge Moscovici claims that the answer lies in their behavioural style, i.
e.
 the way .
 The crucial factor in the success of the suffragette movement was that its supporters were consistent in their views, and this created a considerable degree of social influence.
 Minorities that are active and organised, who support and defend their position consistently, can create social conflict, doubt and uncertainty among members of the majority, and ultimately this may lead to social change.
 Such change has often occurred because a minority has converted others to its point of view.
 Without the influence of minorities, we would have no innovation, no social change.
 Many of what we now regard as major social movements e.
g.
 Christianity, trade unionism or feminism were originally due to the influence of an outspoken minority.

 Heritage is concerned with the ways in which very selective material artefacts, mythologies, memories and traditions become resources for the present.
 The contents, interpretations and representations of the resource are selected according to the demands of the present an imagined past provides resources for a heritage that is to be passed onto an imagined future.
 It follows too that the meanings and functions of memory and tradition are defined in the present.
 Further, heritage is more concerned with meanings than material artefacts.
 It is the former that give value, either cultural or financial, to the latter and explain why they have been selected from the near infinity of the past.
 In turn, they may later be discarded as the demands of present societies change, or even, as is presently occurring in the former Eastern Europe, when pasts have to be reinvented to reflect new presents.
 Thus heritage is.
 about preserving universal cultural valuesa mirror reflecting the artefacts of the pastneither concerned with the present nor the futureas much about forgetting as remembering the pasta collection of memories and traditions of a society.
 The human species is unique in its ability to expand its functionality by inventing new cultural tools.
 Writing, arithmetic, science  all are recent inventions.
 Our brains did not have enough time to evolve for them, but I reason that they were made possible because.
 When we learn to read, we recycle a specific region of our visual system known as the visual wordform area, enabling us to recognize strings of letters and connect them to language areas.
 Likewise, when we learn Arabic numerals we build a circuit to quickly convert those shapes into quantities  a fast connection from bilateral visual areas to the parietal quantity area.
 Even an invention as elementary as fingercounting changes our cognitive abilities dramatically.
 Amazonian people who have not invented counting are unable to make exact calculations as simple as, say, .
 This cultural recycling implies that the functional architecture of the human brain results from a complex mixture of biological and cultural constraints.

When photography came along in the nineteenth century, painting was put in crisis.
 The photograph, it seemed, did the work of imitating nature better than the painter ever could.
 Some painters made practical use of the invention.
 There were Impressionist painters who used a photograph in place of the model or landscape they were painting.
 But by and large, the photograph was a challenge to painting and was one cause of paintings moving away from direct representation and reproduction to the abstract painting of the twentieth century.
 Therefore, the painters of that century put more focus on expressing nature, people, and cities as they were in reality.
 Since photographs did such a good job of representing things as they existed in the world, painters were freed to look inward and represent things as they were in their imagination, rendering emotion in the color, volume, line, and spatial configurations native to the painters art.

Researchers in psychology follow the scientific method to perform studies that help explain and may predict human behavior.
 This is a much more challenging task than studying snails or sound waves.
A But for all of these difficulties for psychology, the payoff of the scientific method is that the findings are replicable that is, if you run the same study again following the same procedures, you will be very likely to get the same results.
B It often requires compromises, such as testing behavior within laboratories rather than natural settings, and asking those readily available such as introduction to psychology students to participate rather than collecting data from a true crosssection of the population.
 It often requires great cleverness to conceive of measures that tap into what people are thinking without altering their thinking, called reactivity.

 People may give answers that they feel are more socially desirable than their true feelings.

Clearly, schematic knowledge helps you  guiding your understanding and enabling you to reconstruct things you cannot remember.
 A Likewise, if there are things you cant recall, your schemata will fill in the gaps with knowledge about whats typical in that situation.
 As a result, a reliance on schemata will inevitably make the world seem more normal than it really is and will make the past seem more regular than it actually was.
B Any reliance on schematic knowledge, therefore, will be shaped by this information about whats normal.
 Thus, if there are things you dont notice while viewing a situation or event, your schemata will lead you to fill in these gaps with knowledge about whats normally in place in that setting.
 C But schematic knowledge can also hurt you, promoting errors in perception and memory.
 Moreover, the types of errors produced by schemata are quite predictable Bear in mind that schemata summarize the broad pattern of your experience, and so they tell you, in essence, whats typical or ordinary in a given situation.

The advent of literacy and the creation of handwritten scrolls and, eventually, handwritten books strengthened the ability of large and complex ideas to spread with high fidelity.
The printing press boosted the power of ideas to copy themselves.
 Prior to lowcost printing, ideas could and did spread by word of mouth.
 While this was tremendously powerful, it limited the complexity of the ideas that could be propagated to those that a single person could remember.
   It also added a certain amount of guaranteed error.
   The spread of ideas by word of mouth was equivalent to a game of telephone on a global scale.
   But the incredible amount of time required to copy a scroll or book by hand limited the speed with which information could spread this way.
   A welltrained monk could transcribe around four pages of text per day.
   A printing press could copy information thousands of times faster, allowing knowledge to spread far more quickly, with full fidelity, than ever before.

A round hill rising above a plain, therefore, would appear on the map as a set of concentric circles, the largest at the base and the smallest near the top.
A major challenge for mapmakers is the depiction of hills and valleys, slopes and flatlands collectively called the topography.
 This can be done in various ways.
 One is to create an image of sunlight and shadow so that wrinkles of the topography are alternately lit and shaded, creating a visual representation of the shape of the land.
   Another, technically more accurate way is to draw contour lines.
   A contour line connects all points that lie at the same elevation.
   When the contour lines are positioned closely together, the hills slope is steep if they lie farther apart, the slope is gentler.
   Contour lines can represent scarps, hollows, and valleys of the local topography.
   At a glance, they reveal whether the relief in the mapped area is great or small a busy contour map means lots of high relief.

Biological organisms, including human societies both with and without market systems, discount distant outputs over those available at the present time based on risks associated with an uncertain future.
 As the timing of inputs and outputs varies greatly depending on the type of energy, there is a strong case to incorporate time when assessing energy alternatives.
 For example, the energy output from solar panels or wind power engines, where most investment happens before they begin producing, may need to be assessed differently when compared to most fossil fuel extraction technologies, where a large proportion of the energy output comes much sooner, and a larger relative proportion of inputs is applied during the extraction process, and not upfront.
 Thus fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, in addition to having energy quality advantages cost, storability, transportability, etc.
 over many renewable technologies, also have a temporal advantage after accounting for human behavioral preference for current consumptionreturn.

Industrial capitalism not only created work, it also created leisure in the modern sense of the term.
 This might seem surprising, for the early cotton masters wanted to keep their machinery running as long as possible and forced their employees to work very long hours.
 However, by requiring continuous work during work hours and ruling out nonwork activity, employers had a separated out leisure from work.
 Some did this quite explicitly by creating distinct holiday periods, when factories were shut down, because it was better to do this than have work b promoted by the casual taking of days off.
 Leisure as a distinct nonwork time, whether in the form of the holiday, weekend, or evening, was a result of the disciplined and bounded work time created by capitalist production.
 Workers then wanted more leisure and leisure time was enlarged by union campaigns, which first started in the cotton industry, and eventually new laws were passed that c limited the hours of work and gave workers holiday entitlements.
Leisure was also the creation of capitalism in another sense, through the commercialization of leisure.
 This no longer meant participation in traditional sports and pastimes.
 Workers began to d pay for leisure activities organized by capitalist enterprises.
 Mass travel to spectator sports, especially football and horseracing, where people could be charged for entry, was now possible.
 The importance of this can hardly be exaggerated, for whole new industries were emerging to exploit and e develop the leisure market, which was to become a huge source of consumer demand, employment, and profit.
