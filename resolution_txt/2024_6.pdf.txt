While the mechanic worked on her car, Jennifer walked back and forth in the waiting room.
She was deeply concerned about how much it was going to cost to get her car fixed.
Her car’s engine had started making noises and kept losing power that morning, and she had heard that replacing an engine could be very expensive.
After a few minutes, the mechanic came back into the waiting room.
“I’ve got some good news.
It was just a dirty spark plug.
I already wiped it clean and your car is as good as new.” He handed her the bill and when she checked it, the overall cost of repairs came to less than ten dollars.
That was far less than she had expected and she felt at ease, knowing she could easily afford it.

Certain hindrances to multifaceted creative activity may lie in premature specialization, i.e., having to choose the direction of education or to focus on developing one ability too early in life.
However, development of creative ability in one domain may enhance effectiveness in other domains that require similar skills, and flexible switching between generality and specificity is helpful to productivity in many domains.
Excessive specificity may result in information from outside the domain being underestimated and unavailable, which leads to fixedness of thinking, whereas excessive generality causes chaos, vagueness, and shallowness.
Both tendencies pose a threat to the transfer of knowledge and skills between domains.
What should therefore be optimal for the development of crossdomain creativity is support for young people in taking up creative challenges in a specific domain and coupling it with encouragement to apply knowledge and skills in, as well as from, other domains, disciplines, and tasks.

Lawyers sometimes describe ownership as a bundle of sticks.
This metaphor was introduced about a century ago, and it has dramatically transformed the teaching and practice of law.
The metaphor is useful because it helps us see ownership as a grouping of interpersonal rights that can be separated and put back together.
When you say It’s mine in reference to a resource, often that means you own a lot of the sticks that make up the full bundle the sell stick, the rent stick, the right to mortgage, license, give away, even destroy the thing.
Often, though, we split the sticks up, as for a piece of land there may be a landowner, a bank with a mortgage, a tenant with a lease, a plumber with a license to enter the land, an oil company with mineral rights.
Each of these parties owns a stick in the bundle.

When it comes to the Internet, it just pays to be a little paranoid (but not a lot).
Given the level of anonymity with all that resides on the Internet, it’s sensible to question the validity of any data that you may receive.
Typically it’s to our natural instinct when we meet someone coming down a sidewalk to place yourself in some manner of protective position, especially when they introduce themselves as having known you, much to your surprise.
By design, we set up challenges in which the individual must validate how they know us by presenting scenarios, names or acquaintances, or evidence by which to validate (that is, photographs).
Once we have received that information and it has gone through a cognitive validation, we accept that person as more trustworthy.
All this happens in a matter of minutes but is a natural defense mechanism that we perform in the real world.
However, in the virtual world, we have a tendency to be less defensive, as there appears to be no physical threat to our wellbeing.

There are pressures within the museum that cause it to emphasise what happens in the galleries over the activities that take place in its unseen zones.
In an era when museums are forced to increase their earnings, they often focus their energies on modernising their galleries or mounting temporary exhibitions to bring more and more audiences through the door.
In other words, as museums struggle to survive in a competitive economy, their budgets often prioritise those parts of themselves that are consumable infotainment in the galleries, goods and services in the cafes and the shops.
The unlit, unglamorous storerooms, if they are ever discussed, are at best presented as service areas that process objects for the exhibition halls.
And at worst, as museums pour more and more resources into their publicly visible faces, the spaces of storage may even suffer, their modernisation being kept on hold or being given less and less space to house the expanding collections and serve their complex conservation needs.

Hypermobility ― the notion that more travel at faster speeds covering longer distances generates greater economic success ― seems to be a distinguishing feature of urban areas, where more than half of the world’s population currently reside.
By , approximately .
billion trips were made each day in cities worldwide.
In , there may be three to four times as many passengerkilometres travelled as in the year , infrastructure and energy prices permitting.
Freight movement could also rise more than threefold during the same period.
Mobility flows have become a key dynamic of urbanization, with the associated infrastructure invariably constituting the backbone of urban form.
Yet, despite the increasing level of urban mobility worldwide, access to places, activities and services has become increasingly difficult.
Not only is it less convenient ― in terms of time, cost and comfort ―to access locations in cities, but the very process of moving around in cities generates a number of negative externalities.
Accordingly, many of the world’s cities face an unprecedented accessibility crisis, and are characterized by unsustainable mobility systems.

Jean Renoir (), a French film director, was born in Paris, France.
He was the son of the famous painter PierreAuguste Renoir.
He and the rest of the Renoir family were the models of many of his father’s paintings.
At the outbreak of World War I, Jean Renoir was serving in the French army but was wounded in the leg.
In , he made La Grande Illusion, one of his betterknown films.
It was enormously successful but was not allowed to show in Germany.
During World War II, when the Nazis invaded France in , he went to Hollywood in the United States and continued his career there.
He was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his career, including the Academy Honorary Award in  for his lifetime achievements in the film industry.
Overall, Jean Renoir’s influence as a filmmaker and artist endures.

Consider The Wizard of Oz as a psychological study of motivation.
Dorothy and her three friends work hard to get to the Emerald City, overcoming barriers, persisting against all adversaries.
They do so because they expect the Wizard to give them what they are missing.
Instead, the wonderful (and wise) Wizard makes them aware that they, not he, always had the power to fulfill their wishes.
For Dorothy, home is not a place but a feeling of security, of comfort with people she loves; it is wherever her heart is.
The courage the Lion wants, the intelligence the Scarecrow longs for, and the emotions the Tin Man dreams of being attributes they already possess.
They need to think about these attributes not as internal conditions but as positive ways in which they are already relating to others.
After all, didn’t they demonstrate those qualities on the journey to Oz, a journey motivated by little more than an expectation, an idea about the future likelihood of getting something they wanted adversary ()

To the extent that an agent relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than on its own percepts, we say that the agent lacks autonomy.
A rational agent should be autonomous ―it should learn what it can to (A) compensate  prepare for partial or incorrect prior knowledge.
For example, a vacuumcleaning agent that learns to foresee where and when additional dirt will appear will do better than one that does not.
As a practical matter, one seldom requires complete autonomy from the start when the agent has had little or no experience, it would have to act (B) purposefully  randomly unless the designer gave some assistance.
So, just as evolution provides animals with enough builtin reflexes to survive long enough to learn for themselves, it would be reasonable to provide an artificial intelligent agent with some initial knowledge as well as an ability to learn.
After sufficient experience of its environment, the behavior of a rational agent can become effectively (C) independent  protective of its prior knowledge.
Hence, the incorporation of learning allows one to design a single rational agent that will succeed in a vast variety of environments.(A)(B)(C)compensate randomly protectivecompensate purposefully  protectiveprepare randomly protectivecompensate randomly independentprepare purposefully  independent

People have always needed to eat, and they always will.
Rising emphasis on selfexpression values does not put an end to material desires.
But prevailing economic orientations are gradually being reshaped.
People who work in the knowledge sector continue to seek high salaries, but they place equal or greater emphasis on doing stimulating work and being able to follow their own time schedules.
Consumption is becoming progressively less determined by the need for sustenance and the practical use of the goods consumed.
People still eat, but a growing component of food’s value is determined by its aspects.
People pay a premium to eat exotic cuisines that provide an interesting experience or that symbolize a distinctive lifestyle.
The publics of postindustrial societies place growing emphasis on “political consumerism,” such as boycotting goods whose production violates ecological or ethical standards.
Consumption is less and less a matter of sustenance and more and more a question of lifestyle ― and choice.

Interestingly, experts do not suffer as much as beginners when performing complex tasks or combining multiple tasks.
Because experts have extensive practice within a limited domain, the key component skills in their domain tend to be highly practiced and more automated.
Each of these highly practiced skills then demands relatively few cognitive resources, effectively lowering the total cognitive load that experts experience.
Thus, experts can perform complex tasks and combine multiple tasks relatively easily.
Furthermore, beginners are excellent at processing the tasks when the tasks are divided and isolated.
This is not because they necessarily have more cognitive resources than beginners; rather, because of the high level of fluency they have achieved in performing key skills, they can do more with what they have.
Beginners, on the other hand, have not achieved the same degree of fluency and automaticity in each of the component skills, and thus they struggle to combine skills that experts combine with relative ease and efficiency.

.The growing complexity of computer software has direct implications for our global safety and security, particularly as the physical objects upon which we depend ― things like cars, airplanes, bridges, tunnels, and implantable medical devices ― transform themselves into computer code.

.Instead, much like the young child learning how to play ‘nicely’, the apprentice scientist gains his or her understanding of the moral values inherent in the role by absorption from their colleagues ― socialization.As particular practices are repeated over time and become more widely shared, the values that they embody are reinforced and reproduced and we speak of them as becoming ‘institutionalized’.
( ) In some cases, this institutionalization has a formal face to it, with rules and protocols written down, and specialized roles created to ensure that procedures are followed correctly.
( ) The main institutions of state ―parliament, courts, police and so on ― along with certain of the professions, exhibit this formal character.
( ) Other social institutions, perhaps the majority, are not like this; science is an example.
( ) Although scientists are trained in the substantive content of their discipline, they are not formally instructed in ‘how to be a good scientist’.

When trees grow together, nutrients and water can be optimally divided among them all so that each tree can grow into the best tree it can be.
If you “help” individual trees by getting rid of their supposed competition, the remaining trees are bereft.
They send messages out to their neighbors unsuccessfully, because nothing remains but stumps.
Every tree now grows on its own, giving rise to great differences in productivity.
( ) Some individuals photosynthesize like mad until sugar positively bubbles along their trunk.( ) This is because a tree can be only as strong as the forest that surrounds it.
( ) And there are now a lot of losers in the forest.
( ) Weaker members, who would once have been supported by the stronger ones, suddenly fall behind.

The evolutionary process works on the genetic variation that is available.
It follows that natural selection is unlikely to lead to the evolution of perfect, ‘maximally fit’ individuals.
Rather, organisms come to match their environments by being ‘the fittest available’ or ‘the fittest yet’ they are not ‘the best imaginable’.
Part of the lack of fit arises because the present properties of an organism have not all originated in an environment similar in every respect to the one in which it now lives.
Over the course of its evolutionary history, an organism’s remote ancestors may have evolved a set of characteristics ― evolutionary ‘baggage’ ― that subsequently constrain future evolution.
For many millions of years, the evolution of vertebrates has been limited to what can be achieved by organisms with a vertebral column.
Moreover, much of what we now see as precise matches between an organism and its environment may equally be seen as constraints koala bears live successfully on Eucalyptus foliage, but, from another perspective, koala bears cannot live without Eucalyptus foliage.

Many negotiators assume that all negotiations involve a fixed pie.
Negotiators often approach integrative negotiation opportunities as zerosum situations or winlose exchanges.
Those who believe in the mythical fixed pie assume that parties’ interests stand in opposition, with no possibility for integrative settlements and mutually beneficial tradeoffs, so they (a) suppress efforts to search for them.
In a hiring negotiation, a job applicant who assumes that salary is the only issue may insist on , when the employer is offering ,.
Only when the two parties discuss the possibilities further do they discover that moving expenses and starting date can also be negotiated, which may (b) block resolution of the salary issue.The tendency to see negotiation in fixedpie terms (c) varies depending on how people view the nature of a given conflict situation.
This was shown in a clever experiment by Harinck, de Dreu, and Van Vianen involving a simulated negotiation between prosecutors and defense lawyers over jail sentences.
Some participants were told to view their goals in terms of personal gain (e.g., arranging a particular jail sentence will help your career), others were told to view their goals in terms of effectiveness (a particular sentence is most likely to prevent recidivism), and still others were told to focus on values (a particular jail sentence is fair and just).
Negotiators focusing on personal gain were most likely to come under the influence of fixedpie beliefs and approach the situation (d) competitively.
Negotiators focusing on values were least likely to see the problem in fixedpie terms and more inclined to approach the situation cooperatively.
Stressful conditions such as time constraints contribute to this common misperception, which in turn may lead to (e) less integrative agreements.

I have an English essay assignment I need to finish.” Her mother persisted, “Come on Your father’s birthday is just around the corner, and you wanted to buy his birthday present by yourself.” Ellen suddenly realized that her father’s birthday was just two days away.
So (a) she altered her original plan to do the assignment in the library and decided to go to the shopping mall with her mother.(B)Ellen wanted to get a strawberry smoothie in the cafe, but it was sold out.
So she bought a yogurt smoothie instead.
The cafe was not very busy for a Saturday afternoon, and Ellen settled at a large table to work on her assignment.
However, after a while, a group of students came in, and there weren’t any large tables left.
One of them came over to Ellen’s table and politely asked, “Could (b) you possibly move to that smaller table” Ellen replied, “It’s okay.
I was just leaving anyway.” She hurriedly gathered her assignment leaving the shoe bag behind under the table.(C)Upon arrival at the shopping center, her mother inquired, “Ellen, have you decided what to buy for his birthday present” She quickly replied, “(c) I would like to buy him a pair of soccer shoes.” Ellen knew that her father had joined the morning soccer club recently and needed some new soccer shoes.
She entered a shoe store and selected a pair of red soccer shoes.
After buying the present, she told her mother, “Mom, now, I’m going to do my assignment in the cafe while you are shopping.”(D)“It must be in the cafe,” Ellen suddenly exclaimed when (d) she realized the gift for her father was missing upon returning home.
She felt so disheartened, worrying it would be impossible to find it.
“Why don’t you call the cafe” suggested her mother.
When she phoned the cafe and asked about the shoe bag, the manager said that she would check and let her know.
After a few minutes, she called back and told Ellen that (e) she had just discovered it.
Ellen was so pleased that the birthday gift had been found.
