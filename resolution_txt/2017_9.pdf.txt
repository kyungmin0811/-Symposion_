Dear Organizer,My name is Cathy Cameron.
I’m writing in regards to the “Boston Red Sox Baseball Trip” for the game with the Yankees taking place on Saturday, September rd.
Unfortunately, I have just become aware that your company’s limit of  people for registration has already been reached.
However, I would really appreciate it if you could allow my son to register additionally.
He is a big fan of the Red Sox, and this trip would make a great surprise gift for his birthday.
If there is any way that he is able to join the trip, I would be very grateful.
I’m sure it would give him the perfect birthday.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours sincerely,Cathy Cameron

Amy was in the classroom staring out of the window beside her.
She thought how her gloomy face in the window reflected her mistake.
She tried not to think about her terrible performance in class.
Watching Amy look so discouraged, Laurie, her best friend, decided she needed some cheering up.
So Laurie crossed her eyes and made a stupid face.
Amy tried not to look, but Laurie was making another funny face.
This time she couldn’t help turning back to see what her friend was doing.
It was her famous fish face she was pushing her ears out, crossing her eyes, and opening her mouth wide.
Amy laughed hard.
She felt that she was lucky to have a friend that could always cheer her up when she was feeling down.

My barelyfiveyearold son couldn’t go to bed one night until he wrote “I love you Mom” on a piece of paper.
Pajamas on, red crayon in hand, he was very determined.
A few mixedup letters, a couple of crumpled papers, and some help from Daddy later, he handed me his heart on the page.
Then, finally, he relaxed enough to fall asleep.
Sometimes, saying how you feel just isn’t enough.
Spoken words are invisible and untouchable.
Write it down, however, and you can see it, feel it, hold it, keep it forever.
Although we may think it, we can’t really give someone our heart.
But by writing, we can give someone our heart on a page.
A love note is a piece of paper that is a little piece of your heart.
Teach your child how to write love notes, and I promise you will have many, many happy returns.

One of the most demanding, and at the same time inspiring, aspects of translating for children is the potential for such creativity that arises from what Peter Hollindale has called the ‘childness’ of children’s texts ‘the quality of being a child ―dynamic, imaginative, experimental, interactive and unstable’.
The ‘unstable’ qualities of childhood that Hollindale cites require a writer or translator to have an understanding of the freshness of language to the child’s eye and ear, the child’s affective concerns and the linguistic and dramatic play of early childhood.
Translating sound, for example, whether in the readaloud qualities of books for the younger child, in animal noises, children’s poetry or in nonsense rhymes, demands imaginative solutions ― as indeed does working with visual material.
Such multifaceted creativity has, at times, placed children’s literature at the forefront of imaginative  experimentation.

From an evolutionary perspective, fear has contributed to both fostering and limiting change, and to preserving the species.
We are programmed to be afraid.
It is a survival need, as is stability, which is another force of nature that can limit the capacity to change.
Stable patterns are necessary lest we live in chaos; however, they make it difficult to abandon entrenched behaviors, even those that are no longer useful, constructive, or health creating.
And fear can keep you from changing when you don’t want to risk a step into unknown territory; for example, some people choose not to leave an unfulfilling job or a failing relationship because they fear the unknown more than the known.
On the other hand, fear can also motivate change in order to avoid something you’re afraid of, such as dying young ― as one of your parents might have.

A strategic vision has little value to the organization unless it’s effectively communicated down the line to lowerlevel managers and employees.
It would be difficult for a vision statement to provide direction to decision makers and energize employees toward achieving longterm strategic intent unless they know of the vision and observe management’s commitment to that vision.
Communicating the vision to organization members nearly always means putting “where we are going and why” in writing, distributing the statement organizationwide, and having executives personally explain the vision and its justification to as many people as possible.
Ideally, executives should present their vision for the company in a manner that reaches out and grabs people’s attention.
An engaging and convincing strategic vision has enormous motivational value ―for the same reason that a stone mason is inspired by building a great cathedral for the ages.

The Kung San, also known as the Bushmen, live in the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa.
The “K” in the name “Kung” is like the sound that occurs when a cork is pulled from a bottle.
Traditionally, they lived by hunting and gathering, the way of life that was the universal mode of human existence until , years ago.
The total population of the Kung San in  was about ,, with most of them living in nonhunting and gathering situations on cattleposts or farms.
The Kung San in the Dobe area of Botswana were divided into twenty five groups with a mean size of eighteen to twenty people.
The Kung San in that area had abundant food supply and a lot of leisure time.
The main food crop was the wild mongongo nut, millions of which were harvested every year.

Like life in traditional society, but unlike other team sports, baseball is not governed by the clock.
A football game is comprised of exactly sixty minutes of play, a basketball game forty or fortyeight minutes, but baseball has no set length of time within which the game must be completed.
The pace of the game is therefore leisurely and (A) unhurried  unhurriedly, like the world before the discipline of measured time, deadlines, schedules, and wages paid by the hour.
Baseball belongs to the kind of world (B) which  in which people did not say, “I haven’t got all day.” Baseball games do have all day to be played.
But that does not mean that they can go on forever.
Baseball, like traditional life, proceeds according to the rhythm of nature, specifically the rotation of the Earth.
During its first half century, games were not played at night, which meant that baseball games, like the traditional work day, (C) ending  ended when the sun set.(A)(B)(C)unhurried in which  endedunhurried which endingunhurriedly  which endedunhurriedly  which endingunhurriedly  in which  endedName Our Sports CenterThe grand opening of our brandnew sports center is on November th, but we still don’t have a name Please take this opportunity to be part of Watford Community history, and help us name itEntry SubmissionSeptember stth on our website (www.watfordcc.org)The three best entries will be selected by the Watford volunteer group and will be made available online for voting to decide the winner.VoteOctober thst on our websiteWinner AnnouncementNovember rd on our websitePrize a oneyear sports center membershipWe’re looking for the most dynamic and fun names, so get your entries in nowWatford Community Council Fashion Career Discovery DayExperience our Fashion Career Discovery Day and unlock pathways to a fulfilling career in fashion Your day will include interviews with professional designers, as well as the opportunity to watch a fashion show.Date Saturday, November , Time  a.m.

You can’t have a democracy if you can’t talk with your neighbors about matters of mutual interest or concern.
Thomas Jefferson, who had an enduring interest in democracy, came to a similar conclusion.
He was prescient in understanding the dangers of (A) concentrated  limited power, whether in corporations or in political leaders or exclusionary political institutions.
Direct involvement of citizens was what had made the American Revolution possible and given the new republic vitality and hope for the future.
Without that involvement, the republic would die.
Eventually, he saw a need for the nation to be (B) blended  subdivided into “wards” ― political units so small that everyone living there could participate directly in the political process.
The representatives for each ward in the capital would have to be (C) resistant  responsive to citizens organized in this way.
A vibrant democracy conducted locally would then provide the active basic unit for the democratic life of the republic.
With that kind of involvement, the republic might survive and prosper.

A sleeping mother has the ability to identify the particular cry of her own baby.
This is one of the bonding factors that has been forgotten because of the way in which we live today.
Typically, there is now only one newborn baby in any family house or apartment, so there is no way to test this ability.
In an ancient tribe, however, living in small huts in a tiny village settlement, a mother would have been able to hear any of the babies crying in the night.
If she woke up every time one of them screamed for food, she might get no sleep at all.
During the course of evolution she became programmed to awake only at the sound of her own particular baby.
This  is still there to this day, even though it is seldom used.

The pull effect of a destination can be positively influenced by the introduction and reinforcement of protourism policies that make a destination more accessible.
Governments, for example, can and often do employ awareness campaigns among the resident population to promote a welcoming attitude towards visitors, in order to foster a positive market image.
However, because such campaigns depend on widespread social engineering, and because their effects can be counteracted by random acts of violence, positive outcomes cannot be guaranteed.
Most governments in developing countries encourage international tourism because tourists from wealthy countries usually spend more.
Furthermore, it is the behaviour of some tourists, and the structure and development of tourism itself, that often generate negative attitudes within the host community.
This implies that major structural changes to tourism itself, rather than awareness campaigns, may be required to foster a welcoming attitude.

.Psychologists Dember and Earl suggested that the motivation for exploration had its roots in a curiosity drive.(A) This is very important for understanding why people will often return to explore things that they explored before or do things they have done before.
In our daily lives, for example, we might decide to listen to a piece of music that we have listened to many times.(B) By returning to that music with a new or fresh perspective, perhaps as a result of listening to other music, we find something new and interesting.
One reason that people can play a card game such as bridge over and over is that no matter how many times you have played the game, it will be different in some way.
(C) They suggested that curiosity is stimulated by novelty and argued that novelty is in the eye of the beholder.
We could have seen something many times before, but as the result of having new skills or competence, we discover new or different aspects of that object.

.Even so, research confirms the finding that nonverbal cues are more credible than verbal cues, especially when verbal and nonverbal cues conflict.Researchers have reported various nonverbal features of sarcasm.
( ) Most disagree as to whether nonverbal cues are essential to the perception of sarcasm or the emotion that prompts it.
( ) Also, nonverbal cues are better indicators of speaker intent.
( ) As the nature of sarcasm implies a contradiction between intent and message, nonverbal cues may “leak” and reveal the speaker’s true mood as they do in deception.
( ) Ostensibly, sarcasm is the opposite of deception in that a sarcastic speaker typically intends the receiver to recognize the sarcastic intent; whereas, in deception the speaker typically intends that the receiver not recognize the deceptive intent.
( ) Thus, when communicators are attempting to determine if a speaker is sarcastic, they compare the verbal and nonverbal message and if the two are in opposition, communicators may conclude that the speaker is being sarcastic.
sarcasm     ostensibly .This dynamic can be illustrated with the example of parents who place equal value on convenience and concern for the environment.Our total set of values and their relative importance to us constitute our value system.
( ) The way that we behave in a given situation is often influenced by how important one value is to us relative to others.
( ) For instance, deciding whether to spend Saturday afternoon relaxing with your family or exercising will be determined by the relative importance that you place on family versus health.
( ) You feel value conflict when you do something that is consistent with one value but inconsistent with another equally important value.
( ) They may experience value conflict if they buy disposable diapers for their babies.
( ) Consumers facing such decisions consider not only the product’s immediate consumption outcomes but also the product’s general effect on society, including how the manufacturer behaves (e.g., toward the environment).

In science one experiment, whether it succeeds or fails, is logically followed by another in a theoretically infinite progression.
According to the underlying myth of modern science, this progression is always replacing the smaller knowledge of the past with the larger knowledge of the present, which will be replaced by the yet larger knowledge of the future.
In the arts, by contrast, no limitless sequence of works is ever implied or looked for.
No work of art is necessarily followed by a second work that is necessarily better.
Given the methodologies of science, the law of gravity and the genome were bound to be discovered by somebody; the identity of the discoverer is incidental to the fact.
But it appears that in the arts there are no second chances.
We must assume that we had one chance each for The Divine Comedy and King Lear.
If Dante and Shakespeare had died before they wrote those works, nobody ever would have written them.While scientific knowledge is believed to progress through (A)experiments, an artistic work tends to be (B)to its creator with no limitless sequence implied.(A)(B)

Three composers attended a show at the Caf Concert des Ambassadeurs.
There they heard performances of a song written by one of them and a sketch written by the other two.
After the performance, the three refused to pay their bill, telling the owner of the caf ‘You use the products of our labour without paying us for it.
So there’s no reason why we should pay for your service’.
The case went to court, and the composers won on appeal.
The decision extended an existing law on theatrical performances to all musical works and all public performance of those works.
This decision created a new category of legal right ― the performing right ― and with it a new economic relationship between music user and copyright owner.
As a result of the decision, these composers and others including music publishers founded a society to enforce and administer their performing rights.
In doing so, they established the principle and practice of the collective administration of rights, based on the fact that ― with the possible exception of opera performances ― it was impossible for a single composer or publisher to monitor every use of his or her work by singers, bands, promoters or, in the twentieth century, broadcasters.
, the new society was entrusted with the task of monitoring music use, issuing licences to music users, negotiating fees, collecting fees and finally distributing the money raised to the composers and songwriters whose works were adding value to other people’s businesses.

What interested me the most about the new house was the stable in the backyard, in which my father let me make a small space for a pony.
I believed that it meant that I would get a pony for Christmas.
(a) He also said, “Lennie, someday you’ll have a pony of your own.” However, “some day” is a pain to a boy who lives in and knows only “now.”Meanwhile my father took me to a pony fair and let me try some ponies, but (b) he always found some fault with them, leaving me in despair.
When Christmas was at hand, I had abandoned all hope of getting one.
Instead, I hung up the biggest stocking I had.
Waking up at  a.m., my little sisters and I raced for the fireplace downstairs.
While my sisters were delighted to find their stockings filled with presents, mine was empty.
I went out into the yard and wept all by myself.
After an hour, my frustration reached its climax, when I saw a man riding a pony with a brandnew saddle.
When he looked at our door, he just passed by, which caused me to break into a flood of tears.
Then, he said, “Kid, do you know a boy named Lennie Steffens” “That’s me,” I replied in tears.
He said, “I’ve been looking all over for your house.
Why don’t you put your house number where it can be seen” He went on saying, “I should have been here at .
Your father told me to bring the pony here and leave (c) him for you.”I’d never seen anything so beautiful as my pony.
And finally, I rode off into the fields.
Thrilled by riding, I began to feast my eyes on the world around me.
The trees seemed to be taking on smiling faces and the birds seemed to be singing to congratulate me on getting my new friend.
When I returned home, my father asked, “Why did you come back so soon” With a smile on my face, I answered (d) him, “I didn’t want to make him feel tired.
It’s his first day with me.” (e) He laughed and wiped away the tear stains from my face ― his heartfelt gesture of apology for such a longdelayed present.
Bursting with happiness, I spent the rest of the day brushing my pony in the stable.
