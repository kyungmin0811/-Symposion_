Stepping up to the microphone, Gabby could feel the sweat starting to run down her face and neck.
She tried to take a deep breath, but couldn’t.
As her name was called, Gabby became more afraid of speaking before a large audience.
Then, she suddenly remembered the words of a woman who had gradually overcome the same fear “Fear, rapid heartbeat, quick breathing, and sweating are simply the body’s declaration that we are ready to fight.” Recalling this, Gabby calmed down and remembered clearly what she had to say.
Assured, Gabby smiled and started to deliver her speech.
The words flowed out like water, and her beating heart gave her more and more mental strength.
The performance was successful.
She had overcome her fear.

Planning involves only the half of your brain that controls your logical thinking.
The other intuitive half of your brain is left out of this planning process.
If you insist on always having a plan, you cut yourself off from your intuitive self and the inner joy it provides.
To break planning addiction, allow yourself one freedom.
Decide to spend a day exploring a park or a neighborhood with curiosity as your only guide.
The next time you feel attracted to someone, and want to introduce yourself, go ahead.
You’ll be likely to make a new friend.
By giving yourself freedom to follow your intuition, you develop your sensitivity to your inner voice.
You learn to hear the quiet messages that can make your life an adventure.

Although the Internet seems truly global these days, less than half of the world’s population has access to it.
Some four billion people are still unconnected.
This spring, IT engineers will begin to shift to the next phase in a grand plan to bring the Internet to everyone.
Their goal is to establish a network of highaltitude balloons that will rain G LTE signals down to anyone with a G device.
Regional telecom companies will transmit the signals to the balloons, and then each balloon will relay the signals to a ground area many miles in diameter.
In this way, farmers in remote areas will be able to access weather data, and rural children will be able to pursue online educations.
By the end of the year, the engineers aim to have  balloons about  miles up.

Tourism is important for more than just vacationing.
Tourism allows people from different places and cultures to come together, and then tourists and host communities learn about each other’s differences and similarities.
They also learn new tastes and ways of thinking, which may lead to a better understanding between hosts and tourists.
Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides for the survival of a society’s culture, especially the culture’s art forms.
The opportunity to sell native artworks to tourists or perform folk dances for them may encourage local artists to preserve traditional art forms.
For example, Fijians have developed their palm mat and shell jewelry crafts into profitable tourist businesses.
They also earn additional income by performing folk dances and fire walking.

The project of creating the tomb of Pope Julius  was originally given to Michelangelo in , but the tomb was not completed until .
It was designed by Michelangelo himself as the pope requested.
The design called for some  statues, and the tomb was to be a giant structure.
Just less than a year after the initial work on the tomb began, it stopped because of lack of funds.
When Pope Julius  died in , he left money for the completion of his tomb, so Michelangelo started work again.
After some years of carving, he completed Moses, one of the most famous statues of the tomb.
However, the next pope, Leo X, had little interest in continuing the project.
As time went on, its scale was reduced, and the project for the tomb was revised again and again.

An independent artist is probably the one who lives closest to an unbounded creative situation.
Many artists have considerable freedom from external requirements about what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and why.
At the same time, however, we know that artists usually limit themselves quite forcefully by choice of material and form of expression.
To make the choice to express a feeling by carving a specific form from a rock, without the use of high technology or colors, restricting the artist significantly.
Such choices are not made to limit creativity, but rather to cultivate it.
When everything is possible, creativity has no tension.
Creativity is strange in that it finds its way in any kind of situation, no matter how restricted, just as the same amount of water flows faster and stronger through a narrow strait than across the open sea.

The desert locust lives in two remarkably different styles depending on the availability of food sources and the density of the local locust population.
When food is scarce, as it usually is in their native desert habitat, locusts are born with coloring designed for camouflage and lead (A) solitary  social  lives.
But when rare periods of significant rain produce major vegetation growth, everything changes.
At first, the locusts continue to be loners, just feasting off the (B) insufficient  abundant  food supply.
But as the extra vegetation starts to die off, the locusts find themselves crowded together.
Suddenly, baby locusts are born with bright colors and a preference for company.
Instead of avoiding one another and hiding from predators through camouflage and inactivity, these locusts gather in vast groups, feed together, and (C) overwhelm  overestimate their predators simply through numbers.

In an increasingly globalized world, literature in translation has an especially important role.
Increasingly, writers, readers, and publishers are turning to literature as a bridge between cultures, particularly Western and Arab societies.
This growing interest is, in turn, driving a boom in translation.
However, not surprisingly perhaps, most translations are from English into other languages, not from another language, such as Arabic, into English.
Hence, the huge American market is seen as driving the            .
Bookstores in the United States, for example, rarely stock more than Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz’s Cairo Trilogy, a masterful, realistic account of life in Cairo and of a merchant family in the midth century.
Western readers likely know little of Mahfouz’s more experimental work, his political and religious allegories, or his historical dramas.
The result is a kind of oneway mirror between America and the rest of the world.

Problems can be distinguished according to whether they are reasonable or unreasonable.
Reasonable problems are of the kind that can be solved in a stepbystep manner.
A crossword puzzle is of this nature.
Given a sufficient vocabulary, the empty spaces can be filled in one by one.
Unreasonable problems,(A), cannot be treated this way because the task contains some ‘trick’ or ‘catch’ that must be understood before someone can arrive at a solution.
This feature frustrates any stepbystep process that proceeds without the realization that “things aren’t what they seem.”(B), successful problem solving in these cases requires that the person acquire an insight into the nature of the trick.
Riddles provide commonplace instances of such insight problems, such as the classic riddle that the Sphinx posed to Oedipus.(A)(B)

School physical education programs should offer a balanced variety of activities that allow young people to develop ability in lifetime activities that are personally meaningful and enjoyable.
A balance should exist in any physical education program among team, dual, and individual (lifetime) sports.
Team sports such as basketball and soccer provide an opportunity for students to develop skills and to enjoy working and competing together as a team.
However, in many school physical education programs, team sports dominate the curriculum at the expense of various individual and dual sports, like tennis, swimming, badminton, and golf.
In such cases, the students lose the opportunity to develop skills in activities that they can participate in throughout their adult lives.
Baseball, in particular, is one of the most popular sports frequently broadcast on TV.
Only through a balanced program of team, dual, and individual sports is it possible to develop wellrounded individuals.

.Cultural characteristics are not only passed from parents to children, but may be passed on from any one individual to another by word of mouth or by writing.(A) Like those infectious diseases, cultural habits such as pop music preferences and clothing fashions may spread very quickly nowadays, especially through the media of radio and television.(B) So some cultural changes may be adopted quite quickly by a whole population.
Transmission of culture is rather like transmission of an infection.
Flu and colds spread very quickly, especially with the large amount of contact that people now have with each other.(C) However, other deeprooted cultural characteristics of races and racial subgroups are much more difficult to change.
These are the cultural patterns that are so resistant to alteration that they have the appearance of being inherent.

.The spoonful of  soup hitting your foot hurts, but not as badly as it would if you accidentally spilled the entire pot of  soup on your foot.Heat and temperature are two quantities that can be easily confused.
Imagine cooking a very large pot of chicken soup on the stove.
Let’s suppose you heat the soup until it is , quite hot.
( ) You grab a spoon and take out a spoonful of soup to taste.
( ) As you remove the spoonful of soup from the pot, it has the same temperature as the larger sample.
( ) Unfortunately, as you bring the soup towards your mouth to taste it, the spoon slips from your hand, pouring its contents on your bare foot.
( ) If both the spoonful and the pot full of soup have the same temperature, why would the larger sample cause more damage if it came in contact with your skin ( ) The answer to the question lies in the difference between temperature and heat..They quickly pick out a whole series of items of the same type, making a handful of, say, small screws.
People make extensive use of searching images.
One unexpected context is sorting.
Suppose you have a bag of small hardware ― screws, nails, and so on ― and you decide to organize them into little jars.
You dump the stuff out on a table and begin separating the items into coherent groups.
( ) It is possible to do this by randomly picking up individual objects, one by one, identifying each one, and then moving it to the appropriate jar.
( ) But what most people do is very different.
( ) They put them in the jar and then go back and do the same for a different kind of item.
( ) So the sorting sequence is nonrandom, producing runs of items of a single type.
( ) It is a faster, more efficient technique, and much of the increased efficiency is due to the use of searching images.

There are two types of managers in business organizations functional managers and project managers.
Both types of managers have different roles and qualities.
Functional managers head one of a firm’s departments such as marketing or engineering, and they are specialists in the area they manage.
They are skilled at breaking the components of a system into smaller elements, knowing something of the details of each operation for which they are responsible.
On the other hand, project managers begin their career as specialists in some field.
When promoted to the position of project manager, they must transform from technical caterpillar to generalist butterfly.
They oversee many functional areas, each with its own specialists.
Therefore, what is required is an ability to put many pieces of a task together to form a coherent whole.
Thus, to understand a frog, for example, functional managers cut it open to examine it, but project managers watch it swim with other frogs and consider the environment.

It isn’t going to be easy making changes to the food your children eat, and even the most careful, patient parents will probably find that the little ones will resist at some point and to some degree.
The problem is that many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as children we learned the hard way.
And the temptation to continue with these parental habits with our own children is strong.If you were made to sit at the table until you had cleaned your plate, you are not alone most of the adult population have suffered this at some point ― at school if not at home.
Forcing your children to eat, especially if they don’t like what is on the plate, is completely .
“Sit there until you finish” may be how we learned, and may also be the only way you feel able to achieve your goal, but think about it the experience of eating a pile of unwanted cabbage until they feel sick is hardly going to make children jump for joy the next time it is served.
This strict approach is very oldfashioned, and you may win the battle but you definitely won’t win the war.
Delaying puddings used to be thought of as a good idea too, but guess what That doesn’t work either.
“No pudding until you have finished your main course” was the standard line when most parents of today were young and is still commonly used, but it only makes sweet things seem more desirable.
