Everyone would like to assume that their wonderful, creative ideas will sell themselves.
But as Galileo, Edvard Munch, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, and millions of others have discovered, they do not.
On the contrary, creative ideas are usually viewed with suspicion and distrust.
Thus, students need to learn how to persuade other people of the value of their ideas.
This selling is part of the practical aspect of creative thinking.
If students do a science project, it is a good idea for them to present it and demonstrate why it makes an important contribution.
If they develop a plan for a new form of government, they should explain why it is better than the existing form of government.

What do you think can make you a good tennis player Suppose there are two different tennis pros giving you tennis lessons.
The first pro says things like “good shot” and “good swing” all the time to encourage you.
The second one says “good swing” only when you make a good swing.
If just hearing “good swing” gives you a reward, then you will prefer the first instructor.
But if what you want is to get better at tennis, you will prefer the second instructor.
That’s because the second instructor’s feedback to you is much more informative than the first one’s.
You’re not after “good swing” rewards; you’re after a better tennis game.
So feedback that simply makes you feel great will not help you develop tennis skills in the long run.

In much of Europe, many businesses close during the month of August when people go on vacation.
Most Europeans believe this is time that they should spend with family or engaging in personal activities.
The French, in particular, value their vacation time and prefer not to work overtime.
They enjoy the longest vacations of any country in the world; French law states that employees must receive a minimum of five weeks of vacation a year.
German companies appear to be moving in this direction as well.
Despite the extended free time, people of both France and Germany are very productive when they work.
To Europeans, their vacation time seems valuable.

When you have ideas you like, you often think everyone else should feel the same way.
If they don’t, it very often becomes a matter of “they just don’t understand” If a colleague around you doesn’t understand your idea, or its potential, you are being given an important message.
Maybe your view of a problem that you think you are solving is not shared by other coworkers If your colleague cannot see it, your consumers may not either.
Think about it.
Make constant efforts until everyone you explain your idea to understands it.
This is all to do with find simple solutions to our daily communication problems.

England’s plan to establish colonies in North America, starting in the late sixteenth century, was founded on a (A) false  valid idea.
It was generally assumed that Virginia, the region of the North American continent to which England laid claim, would have the same climate as the Mediterranean region of Europe, since it lay at similar latitudes.
As a result, the English hoped that the American colonies, once established, would be able to supply Mediterranean goods such as olives and fruit and reduce England’s (B) dependence  restriction on imports from continental Europe.
One prospectus claimed that the colonies would provide “the wines, fruit and salt of France and Spain ...
the silks of Persia and Italy.” Similarly, (C) abundant  scarce timber would do away with the need to import wood from Scandinavia.
In short, America was mistakenly expected to be a land of plenty that would quickly turn a profit.

As Tom stood on stage at the school play, he could feel the watchful eyes of the audience.
Being in the spotlight made him feel tense.
He tried to deliver his lines as best as he could, but he could feel his voice shaking.
Suddenly, he realized he had missed a sentence.
Without going back, he went on as though nothing had happened.
But by the time he finished, his hands felt sweaty and his heart was racing.
No one commented on his mistake ― apart from his drama teacher.
“Well done,” the teacher said.
“Acting is like learning to ride a bike.
You may not get it perfect the first time.
You may fall off a few times, yet each time you get back on you do it better.
Your performance may not have been perfect, but it was great.” His teacher’s comforting words brought a smile to Tom’s face.

It is known that people are extremely limited in the amount of information that they can process at any given time.
A common metaphor in early theories of attention is the concept of a bottleneck.
This metaphor is especially appealing because it matches our understanding about attention.
The narrow neck of a bottle restricts the flow into or out of the bottle.
This kind of flow in the narrow passageway is similar to the way people process information.
In other words, this bottleneck limits the  of information to which we can pay attention.
Thus, when one message is currently flowing through a bottleneck, the other messages must be left behind.

When plants were first grouped together, it was merely for convenience.
Even today, plants may be categorized together in unnatural groupings in order to make them easier to identify.
(A), some wildflower books arrange together all whiteflowered species or all yellowflowered species.
However, such groupings do not reflect natural relationships and make it difficult to recognize family characteristics.
We don’t infer that all persons with red hair are more closely related to each other than they are to those with dark hair; likewise, all longhaired dogs are not more closely related to each other than they are to shorthaired dogs.
Modern botanists, (B), try to group plants according to their natural relationships.

People believe that “good books” are educational and useful to academic success.
However, it appears that the nature of written language itself helps increase academic achievement, regardless of a book’s quality.
Even books that provide only pleasure will increase the confidence of students and encourage them to try to read more technical materials in school.
Comics, magazines, audiobooks, and topics of interest on the Internet are sometimes not considered “real” reading materials.
Students should try to guess the meaning of new words while they read rather than look them up in the dictionary.
However, these materials let students enjoy the pleasure of reading and gain information, literacy skills, and more.
This “light” reading is actually very beneficial because it is effortless reading, which improves reading fluency.

But the ones in which he could get up and do things like industrial arts, drama, science projects, or P.E.
were always his favorites.Jason always seemed to have a tough time in classes, except in the ones where he could do something.
In the classes in which the teachers just stood and talked, or told everyone to read, he seemed to get bored and restless.
( ) He soon realized that he was not a slow or unmotivated learner; he was a kinesthetic learner.
( ) Once he figured this out, he started to use this information to his advantage.
( ) He would draw out what he learned from class on notes, posters, and doodles.
( ) He would act out things and work with other students on projects using role play and drama.
( ) This helped his learning come alive, and he was less bored.
As a result, he not only enjoyed school more, but his grades also went up.

Because the Internet is free space where anybody can post anything, it can be full of all sorts of useless data.
As a result, organized knowledge could easily get corrupted or lost in a sea of junk data.
For books, there are various filters that help readers distinguish between reliable and unreliable information.
On the Internet, the relation between the producer and the consumer of information tends to be direct, so nothing protects the consumer from polluted information.
There are, of course, advantages to the free exchange of information, and I do believe any producers of data should have the freedom to make them available online.
However, I am also convinced that users should be  by intermediary services.
There need to be some forms of guides and filters provided by responsible individuals and organizations.
Otherwise, we may no longer be able to distinguish between the intellectual space of information and a polluted environment of meaningless data.
Thus, reliable intermediary services will be needed in the future.
