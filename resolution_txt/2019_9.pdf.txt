Life is hectic.
Our days are filled with so many of the “have tos” that we feel there’s no time left for the “want tos.” Further, spending all our time with others doesn’t give us the ability to hit the reset button and relax.
Leaving little to no time for ourselves or for the things that are important to us can lead to unmanaged stress, frustration, fatigue, resentment, or worse, health issues.
Building in regular “you time,” however, can provide numerous benefits, all of which help to make life a little bit sweeter and a little bit more manageable.
Unfortunately, many individuals struggle with reaching goals due to an inability to prioritize their own needs.
Alone time, however, forces you to take a break from everyday responsibilities and the requirements of others so you can dedicate time to move forward with your own goals, meet your own personal needs, and further explore your personal dreams.

Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi suggests that the common idea of a creative individual coming up with great insights, discoveries, works, or inventions in isolation is wrong.
Creativity results from a complex interaction between a person and his or her environment or culture, and also depends on timing.
For instance, if the great Renaissance artists like Ghiberti or Michelangelo had been born only  years before they were, the culture of artistic patronage would not have been in place to fund or shape their great achievements.
Consider also individual astronomers Their discoveries could not have happened unless centuries of technological development of the telescope and evolving knowledge of the universe had come before them.
Csikszentmihalyi’s point is that we should devote as much attention to the development of a domain as we do to the people working within it, as only this can properly explain how advances are made.
Individuals are only “a link in a chain, a phase in a process,” he notes.

Consumers like a bottle of wine more if they are told it cost ninety dollars a bottle than if they are told it cost ten.
Belief that the wine is more expensive turns on the neurons in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with pleasure feelings.
Wine without a price tag doesn’t have this effect.
In , American food and wine critics teamed up with a statistician from Yale and a couple of Swedish economists to study the results of thousands of blind tastings of wines ranging from .
to  a bottle.
They found that when they can’t see the price tag, people prefer cheaper wine to pricier bottles.
Experts’ tastes did move in the proper direction they favored finer, more expensive wines.
But the bias was almost imperceptible.
A wine that cost ten times more than another was ranked by experts only seven points higher on a scale of one to one hundred.

s critics separated themselves from the masses by rejecting the ‘natural’ enjoyment afforded by products of mass culture through judgments based on a refined sense of realism.
For example, in most critics championing Douglas Sirk’s films’ social critique, selfreflexivity, and, in particular, distancing effects, there is still a refusal of the ‘vulgar’ enjoyments suspected of soap operas.
This refusal again functions to divorce the critic from an image of a mindless, pleasureseeking crowd he or she has actually manufactured in order to definitively secure the righteous logic of ‘good’ taste.
It also pushes negative notions of female taste and subjectivity.
Critiques of mass culture seem always to bring to mind a disrespectful image of the feminine to represent the depths of the corruption of the people.
The process of tastemaking operated, then, to create hierarchical differences between the aesthete and the masses through the construction of aesthetic positions contrary to the perceived tasteless pleasures of the crowd.

Radioactive waste disposal has become one of the key environmental battlegrounds over which the future of nuclear power has been fought.
Environmentalists argue that no system of waste disposal can be absolutely safe, either now or in the future.
Governments and the nuclear industry have tried to find acceptable solutions.
But in countries where popular opinion is taken into consideration, no mutually acceptable solution has been found.
As a result, most spent fuel has been stored in the nuclear power plants where it was produced.
This is now causing its own problems as storage ponds designed to store a few years’ waste become filled or overflowing.
One avenue that has been explored is the reprocessing of spent fuel to remove the active ingredients.
Some of the recovered material can be recycled as fuel.
The remainder must be stored safely until it has become inactive.
But reprocessing has proved expensive and can exacerbate the problem of disposal rather than assisting it.
As a result, it too appears publicly unacceptable.

Not all organisms are able to find sufficient food to survive, so starvation is a kind of disvalue often found in nature.
It also is part of the process of selection by which biological evolution functions.
Starvation helps filter out those less fit to survive, those less resourceful in finding food for themselves and their young.
In some circumstances, it may pave the way for genetic variants to take hold in the population of a species and eventually allow the emergence of a new species in place of the old one.
Thus starvation is a disvalue that can help make possible the good of greater diversity.
Starvation can be of practical or instrumental value, even as it is an intrinsic disvalue.
What some organisms must starve in nature is deeply regrettable and sad.
The statement remains implacably true, even though starvation also may sometimes subserve ends that are good.

Among the most fascinating natural temperatureregulating behaviors are those of social insects such as bees and ants.
These insects are able to maintain a nearly constant temperature in their hives or mounds throughout the year.
The constancy of these microclimates depends not just on the location and insulation of the habitat, but on .
When the surrounding temperature increases, the activity in the hive decreases, which decreases the amount of heat generated by insect metabolism.
In fact, many animals decrease their activity in the heat and increase it in the cold, and people who are allowed to choose levels of physical activity in hot or cold environments adjust their workload precisely to body temperature.
This behavior serves to avoid both hypothermia and hyperthermia.

While the transportation infrastructure may shape where we travel today, in the early eras of travel, it determined whether people could travel at all.
The development and improvement of transportation was one of the most important factors in allowing modern tourism to develop on a large scale and become a regular part of the lives of billions of people around the world.
Another important factor was the industrialization that led to more efficient transportation of factory products to consumers than ever before.
Technological advances provided the basis for the explosive expansion of local, regional, and global transportation networks and made travel faster, easier, and cheaper.
This not only created new touristgenerating and touristreceiving regions but also prompted a host of other changes in the tourism infrastructure, such as accommodations.
As a result, the availability of transportation infrastructure and services has been considered a fundamental precondition for tourism.

.Most of us have a general, rational sense of what to eat and when ― there is no shortage of information on the subject.(A) Emotional eating is a popular term used to describe eating that is influenced by emotions, both positive and negative.
Feelings may affect various aspects of your eating, including your motivation to eat, your food choices, where and with whom you eat, and the speed at which you eat.
Most overeating is prompted by feelings rather than physical hunger.(B) Yet there is often a disconnect between what we know and what we do.
We may have the facts, but decisions also involve our feelings.
Many people who struggle with difficult emotions also struggle with eating problems.
(C) Individuals who struggle with obesity tend to eat in response to emotions.
However, people who eat for emotional reasons are not necessarily overweight.
People of any size may try to escape an emotional experience by preoccupying themselves with eating or by obsessing over their shape and weight.

Perceptions of forest use and the value of forests as standing timber vary considerably from indigenous peoples to national governments and Western scientists.
These differences in attitudes and values lie at the root of conflicting management strategies and stimulate protest groups such as the Chipko movement.
For example, the cultivators of the Himalayas and Karakoram view forests as essentially a convertible resource.
That is, under increasing population pressure and growing demands for cultivable land, the conversion of forest into cultivated terraces means a much higher productivity can be extracted from the same area.
Compensation in the form of planting on terrace edges occurs to make up for the clearance.
This contrasts with the national view of the value of forests as a renewable resource, with the need or desire to keep a forest cover over the land for soil conservation, and with a global view of protection for biodiversity and climate change purposes, irrespective of the local people’s needs.

As a couple start to form a relationship, they can be seen to develop a set of constructs about their own relationship and, in particular, how it is similar or different to their parents’ relationship.
The couple’s initial disclosures involve them forming constructs about how much similarity there is between them and each other’s families.
What each of them will remember is selective and (a) coloured by their family’s constructs system.
In turn it is likely that as they tell each other their already edited stories, there is a second process of editing whereby what they both hear from each other is again (b) interpreted within their respective family of origin’s construct systems.
The two sets of memories ― the person talking about his or her family and the partner’s edited version of this story ― go into the ‘cookingpot’ of the couple’s new construct system.
Subsequently, one partner may (c) randomly recall a part of the other’s story as a tactic in negotiations for example, Harry may say to Doris that she is being ‘bossy ― just like her mother’.
Since this is probably based on what Doris has told Harry, this is likely to be a very powerful tactic.
She may protest or attempt to rewrite this version of her story, thereby possibly adding further material that Harry could use in this way.
These exchanges of stories need not always be (d) employed in such malevolent ways.
These reconstructed memories can become very powerful, to a point where each partner may become confused even about the simple (e) factual details of what actually did happen in their past.

(A)Over the last week, Jason had been feeling worried about his daughter, Sally.

“This book shows rare birds.
You can’t see any of them around here.” But (c) she insisted, “I spotted a pair of them in their nest in a huge oak tree nearby”(D)Jennifer walked up to Sally and took a close look at the page.

You couldn’t have seen it in this town.” Yet Sally persisted.
“In that case, can you show (e) me the nest” asked Jennifer.
“Yes, I can right now if you want,” answered Sally full of confidence.
Jennifer put on her coat, pulled out a pair of binoculars, and stepped out.
Sally and Jason followed.
