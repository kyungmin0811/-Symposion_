A tear rolled down Lindsay’s cheek.
She thought she had put her favorite toy, Blue Bunny, in her bag before school this morning.
She had ‘show and tell’ in class today, and she was anxious.
Her teacher, Mrs.
Cline, might be angry that she had forgotten to bring it.
She quickly searched the classroom and checked her bag one more time.
Her precious Blue Bunny was a gift from her father, who worked overseas.
It was nowhere to be found.
Just then, Mrs.
Cline appeared in the doorway.
“Mrs.
Cline” Lindsay cried.
“I can’t find my toy to show in class today.
I’m sorry” Mrs.
Cline smiled gently.
She was holding the toy.
“Oh, Mrs.
Cline Thank you.
I thought I had lost Blue Bunny” Lindsay felt calm and comforted now that she had her toy again.

Once you start to see praise for what it is ― and what it does ― these constant little evaluative outbursts from adults start to produce the same effect as fingernails being dragged down a blackboard.
You begin to root for a child to give his teachers or parents a taste of their own treacle by turning around to them and saying (in the same saccharine tone of voice), “Good praising” Still, it’s not an easy habit to break.
It can seem strange, at least at first, to stop praising; it can feel as though you’re being chilly or withholding something.
But that, it soon becomes clear, suggests that we praise more because we need to say it than because children need to hear it.
Whenever that’s true, it’s time to rethink what we’re doing.
What kids do need is unconditional support, love with no strings attached.
That’s not just different from praise ― it’s the opposite of praise.

People sometimes make downward social comparisons ―comparing themselves to inferior or worseoff others ― to feel better about themselves.
This is selfenhancement at work.
But what happens when the only available comparison target we have is superior or better off than we are Can selfenhancement motives still be served in such situations Yes, they can, as captured by the selfevaluation maintenance model.
According to this theory, we shift between two processes ― reflection and comparison ― in a way that lets us maintain favorable selfviews.
In areas that are not especially relevant to our selfdefinition, we engage in reflection, whereby we flatter ourselves by association with others’ accomplishments.
Suppose you care very little about your own athletic skills, but when your friend scores the winning goal during a critical soccer match, you beam with pride, experience a boost to your selfesteem, and take delight in her victory celebrations as if, by association, it were your victory too.

Some psychologists believe that insight is the result of a restructuring of a problem after a period of nonprogress where the person is believed to be too focused on past experience and get stuck.
A new manner to represent the problem is suddenly discovered, leading to a different path to a solution heretofore unpredicted.
It has been claimed that no specific knowledge, or experience is required to attain insight in the problem situation.
As a matter of fact, one should break away from experience and let the mind wander freely.
Nevertheless, experimental studies have shown that insight is actually the result of ordinary analytical thinking.
The restructuring of a problem can be caused by unsuccessful attempts in solving the problem, leading to new information being brought in while the person is thinking.
The new information can contribute to a completely different perspective in finding a solution, thus producing the Aha Experience.

When consumers lack adequate information to make informed choices, governments frequently step in to require that firms provide information.
In the United States, we are all familiar with the mandatory nutritional information placed on food products.
The Securities and Exchange Commission that monitors American stock markets forces firms to meet certain reporting requirements before their stock can be listed on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange.
Such reporting helps ensure that private investors have reliable information on which to base their investment decisions.
Often, however, these regulations do not work adequately, as the Enron scandal in  clearly illustrates.
The oil trading company Enron had cooked its books to overstate its profitability in its mandated reports.
One outcome of Enron’s subsequent financial collapse was the introduction of new regulations designed to improve the reliability of the information that companies must provide to the public.

The brown tree snake has a large head with stickingout eyes.
The head is distinct from the narrow neck.
Its body usually has a light brown background with a series of darker markings or bands on it.
The snake is about  centimeters when it comes out of its egg, and usually reaches  to  meters long.
This snake is infamous for causing the extinction of the majority of native bird species in Guam.
Shortly after World War , the brown tree snake was accidentally brought into Guam from its native range in the South Pacific, probably as an unwanted passenger on a ship or plane.
It is not hunted or eaten by any other animals in Guam and is therefore at the top of its food chain, which has led the snake to increase dramatically in number.

The lack of real, direct experience in and with nature has caused many children to regard the natural world as mere abstraction, that fantastic, beautifully filmed place filled with endangered rainforests and polar bears in peril.
This overstated, often fictionalized version of nature is no more real ― and yet no less real ― to them than the everyday nature right outside their doors, waits to be discovered in a child’s way, at a child’s pace.
Consider the University of Cambridge study which found that a group of eightyearold children was able to identify substantially more characters from animations than common wildlife species.
One wonders whether our children’s inherent capacity to recognize, classify, and order information about their environment ― abilities once essential to our very survival ― is slowly devolving to facilitate life in their increasingly virtualized world.
It’s all part of what Robert Pyle first called “the extinction of experience.” peril    devolve Barrow High School Charity Collection WeekNext week, we will be holding our school charity collection to help local students.

Why does the “pure” acting of the movies not seem unnatural to the audience, who, after all, are accustomed in real life to people whose expression is more or less indistinct Most people’s perception in these matters is not very sharp.
They are not in the habit of observing closely the play of features of their fellow men ― either in real life or at the movies.
They are (A) disappointed  satisfied with grasping the meaning of what they see.
Thus, they often take in the overemphasized expression of film actors more easily than any that is too naturalistic.
And as far as lovers of art are concerned, they do not look at the movies for imitations of nature but for art.
They know that (B) artistic  real representation is always explaining, refining, and making clear the object depicted.

One unspoken truth about creativity ― it isn’t about wild talent so much as it is about .
To find a few ideas that work, you need to try a lot that don’t.
It’s a pure numbers game.
Geniuses don’t necessarily have a higher success rate than other creators; they simply do more ― and they do a range of different things.
They have more successes and more failures.
That goes for teams and companies too.
It’s impossible to generate a lot of good ideas without also generating a lot of bad ideas.
The thing about creativity is that at the outset, you can’t tell which ideas will succeed and which will fail.
So the only thing you can do is try to fail faster so that you can move onto the next idea.

One of the hallmarks of evaluating the quality of a black tea is by assessing how tightly the leaves are rolled.
Generally, highergraded teas are teas with leaves that are tightly and uniformly rolled.
Lowergraded teas, on the other hand, are teas with leaves that are loosely and inconsistently rolled.
With that said, the tightness of the roll has more to do with the steepability of a leaf than it does with the taste of a tea.
The rolling of leaves is done by machine or, sometimes, by hand to break the cell walls of the leaves and release essential oils.
Therefore, one should not evaluate the tea’s drinkability or taste merely because its leaves are not tightly rolled.
It is common to find that people prefer the taste of looser rolled black teas over more expensive or more highly graded black teas that have been tightly rolled.

.It has been said that eye movements are windows into the mind, because where people look reveals what environmental information they are attending to.
However, there is more to attention than just moving the eyes to look at objects.
(A) You may have had this experience if you have been reading a book and then suddenly become aware that although you were moving your eyes across the page and “reading” the words, you had no idea what you had just read.(B) Even though you were looking at the words, you apparently were not paying attention.
There is a mental aspect of attention that involves processing that can occur independently of eye movements.(C) We can pay attention to things that are not directly in our line of vision, as evidenced by the basketball player who dribbles down court while paying attention to a teammate off to the side, just before she throws a perfect pass without looking.
We can also look directly at something without paying attention to it.

.But the examination of the accuracy of information obtained in this manner is not a simple matter.The one area in which the Internet could be considered an aid to thinking is the rapid acquisition of new information.
( ) But this is more fictional than real.
( ) Yes, the simple act of typing a few words into a search engine will virtually instantaneously produce links related to the topic at hand.
( ) What one often gets is no more than abstract summaries of lengthy articles.
( ) As a consequence, I suspect that the number of downloads of any given scientific paper has little relevance to the number of times the entire article has been read from beginning to end.
( ) My advice is that if you want to do some serious thinking, then you’d better disconnect the Internet, phone, and television set and try spending twentyfour hours in absolute solitude..But it is no light matter to quickly and correctly pen a long and complicated composition.
There are many instances of rapid work on the part of the great composers; and their facility and quickness of composition causes great wonder and admiration.
( ) But our admiration is often misdirected.
( ) When we hear of some of the speedy writing of great works by Mozart or Mendelssohn, we might think that this speed was of the composing power as well as of pen, but, in fact, such was seldom the case.
( ) These great musicians generally did their composition mentally without reference to pen or piano, and simply postponed the unpleasant manual labor of committing their music to paper until it became absolutely necessary.
( ) Then they got credit for incredible rapidity of composition.
( ) One has only to copy a piece of music or to try to put into notes some piece of music previously memorized, to realize this.

The weakness of local networks lies in their selfcontainment, for they lack input as well as outreach.
In a classic study of urban politics, Herbert Gans found that neighborhoods with the highest levels of solidarity often were unable to block unfavorable policies and programs for lack of ties to possible allies elsewhere in the city.
It was for this reason that Gans referred to them as “urban villagers.” As the opposite of local networks, cosmopolitan networks offer little solidarity and have little capacity to comfort and sustain members.
But members benefit from a constant flow of new information and from the great reach of their influence, even if it tends to be somewhat lacking in strength.
Local networks tend to be small.
In contrast, cosmopolitan networks can be huge.
Thus, while the “urban villagers” lacked ties even to their local city government, cosmopolitan network ties often lead into the White House.

An ecosystem that is altered or damaged in some way will be out of balance with the biome for that area.
For example, if the local biome is forest, but the trees have been removed from one area, then the ecosystem is out of balance.
The natural tendency is for plant species to move into that area, bringing the ecosystem back towards the biome state.
The spread of a species into a new area is called colonisation.
It can happen naturally only if there are ecologically healthy ecosystems nearby to provide plant seeds.
Once the vegetation has started to recover, insects, birds and other animals will travel into the newly regenerated area.These processes of ecological colonisation can be supported by environmental .
For example, we are currently seeing important changes in the way agriculture is carried out in Britain.
Rather than just maximising food production, farming is becoming more environmentally friendly, with the support of financial subsidies.
This new approach increases biological diversity by conserving hedges and the wildflowers, insects, birds and other animals that live on the land.
A proportion of agricultural land is left completely uncultivated so that species can gradually colonise it.
This provides a habitat for a wider range of species.
Leaving some farmland as setaside is also a way to decrease overall production when that is economically desirable.
Note that setaside land is more permanent than fallow land, which is usually left for only a year.
Colonisation is a slow process, taking place over years or even decades.
