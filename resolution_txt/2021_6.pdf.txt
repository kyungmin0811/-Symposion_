To whom it may concern,My name is Daniel.
Since I joined your youth sports program several years ago, I have really enjoyed swimming.
Thanks to your program, I have become a good swimmer.
Now I want to go one step further.
I like helping people and hope to get a job as a lifeguard later.
So I tried to sign up for your lifeguard training course this summer.
But the course was so popular that the registration closed almost as soon as it opened.
I couldn’t register and was really disappointed.
I heard some of my friends couldn’t, either.
I’m kindly asking you to open an additional course.
I appreciate your consideration.Sincerely,Daniel Smith

Sharon received a ticket to an upcoming tango concert from her friend.
While surfing the Internet, she came across a review for the concert.
The reviewer was harsh, calling it “an awful performance.” That raised in Sharon’s mind the question of whether it was worthwhile to go, but in the end, she reluctantly decided to attend the concert.
The hall located in the old town was ancient and rundown.
Looking around, Sharon again wondered what kind of show she could expect.
But as soon as the tango started, everything changed.
The piano, guitar, flute, and violin magically flew out in harmony.
The audience cheered.
“Oh my goodness What fantastic music” Sharon shouted.
The rhythm and tempo were so energetic and sensational that they shook her body and soul.
The concert was far beyond her expectations.

Occasionally individuals do not merely come out as well as clearly state what is troubling them and instead select more indirect means of expressing their annoyance.
One companion might talk to the various other in a way that is condescending and also indicates underlying hostility.
Numerous other times, partners may mope and even frown without genuinely dealing with an issue.
Companions may likewise merely prevent discussing an issue by swiftly switching over topics when the subject turns up or by being incredibly vague.
Such indirect ways of expressing temper are not useful since they don’t provide the individual that is the target of the behaviors, an idea of exactly how to react.
They understand their companion is irritated, but the absence of directness leaves them without advice regarding what they can do to solve the issue.

Many ancillary businesses that today seem almost core at one time started out as journey edges.
For example, retailers often boost sales with accompanying support such as assembly or installation services.
Think of a home goods retailer selling an unassembled outdoor grill as a box of parts and leaving its customer’s mission incomplete.
When that retailer also sells assembly and delivery, it takes another step in the journey to the customer’s true mission of cooking in his backyard.
Another example is the businesstobusiness service contracts that are layered on top of software sales.
Maintenance, installation, training, delivery, anything at all that turns doityourself into a doitforme solution originally resulted from exploring the edge of where core products intersect with customer journeys.

Official definitions of sport have important implications.
When a definition emphasizes rules, competition, and high performance, many people will be excluded from participation or avoid other physical activities that are defined as “second class.” For example, when a yearold is cut from an exclusive club soccer team, she may not want to play in the local league because she sees it as “recreational activity” rather than a real sport.
This can create a situation in which most people are physically inactive at the same time that a small number of people perform at relatively high levels for large numbers of fans ― a situation that negatively impacts health and increases healthcare costs in a society or community.
When sport is defined to include a wide range of physical activities that are played for pleasure and integrated into local expressions of social life, physical activity rates will be high and overall health benefits are likely.

Problem framing amounts to defining what problem you are proposing to solve.
This is a critical activity because the frame you choose strongly influences your understanding of the problem, thereby conditioning your approach to solving it.
For an illustration, consider Thibodeau and Broditsky’s series of experiments in which they asked people for ways to reduce crime in a community.
They found that the respondents’ suggestions changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast.
People presented with a metaphor comparing crime to a virus invading their city emphasized prevention and addressing the root causes of the problem, such as eliminating poverty and improving education.
On the other hand, people presented with the beast metaphor focused on remediations increasing the size of the police force and prisons.

A common error in current Darwinian thinking is the assumption that “selfish genes” are the prime mover in evolution.
In strict Darwinism the prime mover is environmental threat.
In the absence of threat, natural selection tends to resist change.
It is unbiological to “explain” behavioural change as resulting from genetic change or the ex vacuo emergence of domainspecific brain modules.
Evolutionary psychologists surely know why brains evolved as Cosmides and Tooby point out, brains are found only in animals that move.
Brains are behavioural organs, and behavioural adaptation, being immediate and nonrandom, is vastly more efficient than genetic adaptation.
So, in animals with brains, behavioural change is the usual first response to environmental threat.
If the change is successful, genetic adaptation to the new behaviour will follow more gradually.
Animals do not evolve carnivore teeth and then decide it might be a good idea to eat meat.

Born in Lancashire, England, in , William McDougall left his mark on experimental and physiological psychology.
After receiving a degree in natural sciences in Cambridge University, he became interested in human behavior.
He believed human behavior to be based on three abilities ―intellect, emotion, and will.
Being a hardworking scholar, he held academic positions in several universities in England.
He also wrote many books on psychology including the wellknown Introduction to Social Psychology.
In , he published The Group Mind opposing mechanistic interpretations of human behavior.
However, The Group Mind was poorly received when published.
Somewhat disappointed, he moved to the United States in the same year to be a professor at Harvard University.
Seven years later, he moved to Duke University, where he developed a psychology department and continued various research.
Today many people read his books, and psychologists celebrate his intellectual achievements.

People from more individualistic cultural contexts tend to be motivated to maintain selffocused agency or control as these serve as the basis of one’s selfworth.
With this form of agency comes the belief that individual successes depending primarily on one’s own abilities and actions, and thus, whether by influencing the environment or trying to accept one’s circumstances, the use of control ultimately centers on the individual.
The independent self may be more driven to cope by appealing to a sense of agency or control.
However, people from more interdependent cultural contexts tend to be less focused on issues of individual success and agency and more motivated towards group goals and harmony.
Research has shown that East Asians prefer to receive, but not seek, more social support rather than seek personal control in certain cases.
Therefore, people who hold a more interdependent selfconstrual may prefer to cope in a way that promotes harmony in relationships.

Chunking is vital for cognition of music.
If we had to encode it in our brains note by note, we’d struggle to make sense of anything more complex than the simplest children’s songs.
Of course, most accomplished musicians can play compositions containing many thousands of notes entirely from memory, without a note out of place.
But this seemingly awesome accomplishment of recall is made improbable by remembering the musical process, not the individual notes as such.
If you ask a pianist to start a Mozart sonata from bar fortyone, she’ll probably have to mentally replay the music from the start until reaching that bar ― the score is not simply laid out in her mind, to be read from any random point.
It’s rather like describing how you drive to work you don’t simply recite the names of roads as an abstract list, but have to construct your route by mentally retracing it.
When musicians make a mistake during rehearsal, they wind back to the start of a musical phrase (‘let’s take it from the second verse’) before restarting.

Research with human runners challenged conventional wisdom and found that the groundreaction forces at the foot and the shock transmitted up the leg and through the body after impact with the ground  as runners moved from extremely compliant to extremely hard running surfaces.
As a result, researchers gradually began to believe that runners are subconsciously able to adjust leg stiffness prior to foot strike based on their perceptions of the hardness or stiffness of the surface on which they are running.
This view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff legs when they are moving along on yielding terrain.
As a result, impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly similar over a wide range of running surface types.
Contrary to popular belief, running on concrete is not more damaging to the legs than running on soft sand.

One of the most widespread, and sadly mistaken, environmental myths is that living “close to nature” out in the country or in a leafy suburb is the best “green” lifestyle.
Cities, on the other hand, are often blamed as a major cause of ecological destruction ― artificial, crowded places that suck up precious resources.
Yet, when you look at the facts, nothing could be farther from the truth.
The pattern of life in the country and most suburbs involves long hours in the automobile each week, burning fuel and pumping out exhaust to get to work, buy groceries, and take kids to school and activities.
City dwellers, on the other hand, have the option of walking or taking transit to work, shops, and school.
The larger yards and houses found outside cities also create an environmental cost in terms of energy use, water use, and land use.
This illustrates the tendency that most city dwellers get tired of urban lives and decide to settle in the countryside.
It’s clear that the future of the Earth depends on more people gathering together in compact communities.

.Studies of people struggling with major health problems show that the majority of respondents report they derived benefits from their adversity.
Stressful events sometimes force people to develop new skills, reevaluate priorities, learn new insights, and acquire new strengths.
(A) High levels of adversity predicted poor mental health, as expected, but people who had faced intermediate levels of adversity were healthier than those who experienced little adversity, suggesting that moderate amounts of stress can foster resilience.
A followup study found a similar link between the amount of lifetime adversity and subjects’ responses to laboratory stressors.(B) Intermediate levels of adversity were predictive of the greatest resilience.
Thus, having to deal with a moderate amount of stress may build resilience in the face of future stress.
(C) In other words, the adaptation process initiated by stress can lead to personal changes for the better.
One study that measured participants’ exposure to thirtyseven major negative events found a curvilinear relationship between lifetime adversity and mental health.

.Compounding the difficulty, now more than ever, is what ergonomists call information overload, where a leader is overrun with inputs ― via emails, meetings, and phone calls ― that only distract and confuse her thinking.
 Clarity is often a difficult thing for a leader to obtain.
Concerns of the present tend to seem larger than potentially greater concerns that lie farther away.
( ) Some decisions by their nature present great complexity, whose many variables must come together a certain way for the leader to succeed.
( ) Alternatively, the leader’s information might be only fragmentary, which might cause her to fill in the gaps with assumptions ― sometimes without recognizing them as such.
( ) And the merits of a leader’s most important decisions, by their nature, typically are not clearcut.
( ) Instead those decisions involve a process of assigning weights to competing interests, and then determining, based upon some criterion, which one predominates.
( ) The result is one of judgment, of shades of gray; like saying that Beethoven is a better composer than Brahms.

 When the team painted fireflies’ light organs dark, a new set of bats took twice as long to learn to avoid them.Fireflies don’t just light up their behinds to attract mates, they also glow to tell bats not to eat them.
This twist in the tale of the trait that gives fireflies their name was discovered by Jesse Barber and his colleagues.
The glow’s warning role benefits both fireflies and bats, because these insects taste disgusting to the mammals.
( ) When swallowed, chemicals released by fireflies cause bats to throw them back up.
( ) The team placed eight bats in a dark room with three or four fireflies plus three times as many tasty insects, including beetles and moths, for four days.
( ) During the first night, all the bats captured at least one firefly.
( ) But by the fourth night, most bats had learned to avoid fireflies and catch all the other prey instead.
( ) It had long been thought that firefly bioluminescence mainly acted as a mating signal, but the new finding explains why firefly larvae also glow despite being immature for mating.

Some environments are more likely to lead to fossilization and subsequent discovery than others.
Thus, we cannot assume that more fossil evidence from a particular period or place means that more individuals were present at that time, or in that place.
It may just be that the circumstances at one period of time, or at one location, were more favourable for fossilization than they were at other times, or in other places.
Likewise, the absence of hominin fossil evidence at a particular time or place does not have the same implication as its presence.
As the saying goes, ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’.
Similar logic suggests that taxa are likely to have arisen before they first appear in the fossil record, and they are likely to have survived beyond the time of their most recent appearance in the fossil record.
Thus, the first appearance datum, and the last appearance datum of taxa in the hominin fossil record are likely to be conservative statements about the times of origin and extinction of a taxon.

In many mountain regions, rights of access to water are associated with the possession of land ― until recently in the Andes, for example, land and water rights were (a) combined so water rights were transferred with the land.
However, through state land reforms and the development of additional sources of supply, water rights have become separated from land, and may be sold at auction.
This therefore (b) favours those who can pay, rather than ensuring access to all in the community.
The situation arises, therefore, where individuals may hold land with no water.
In Peru, the government grants water to communities separately from land, and it is up to the community to allocate it.
Likewise in Yemen, the traditional allocation was one measure (tasah) of water to one hundred ‘libnah’ of land.
This applied only to traditional irrigation supplies ― from runoff, wells, etc., where a supply was (c) guaranteed.
Water derived from the capture of flash floods is not subject to Islamic law as this constitutes an uncertain source, and is therefore free for those able to collect and use it.
However, this traditional allocation per unit of land has been bypassed, partly by the development of new supplies, but also by the (d) decrease in cultivation of a crop of substantial economic importance.
This crop is harvested throughout the year and thus requires more than its fair share of water.
The economic status of the crop (e) ensures that water rights can be bought or bribed away from subsistence crops.

(A)“Congratulations” That was the first word that Steven saw when he opened the envelope that his dad handed to him.
He knew that he would win the essay contest.
Overly excited, he shouted, “Hooray” At that moment, two tickets to Ace Amusement Park, the prize, slipped out of the envelope.
He picked them up and read the letter thoroughly while sitting on the stairs in front of his house.
“Wait a minute That’s not my name” (a) he said, puzzled.
The letter was addressed to his classmate Stephanie, who had also participated in the contest.(B)Once Steven had heard his dad’s words, tears started to fill up in his eyes.
“I was foolish,” Steven said regretfully.
He took the letter and the prize to school and handed them to Stephanie.
He congratulated her wholeheartedly and she was thrilled.
On the way home after school, his steps were light and full of joy.
That night, his dad was very pleased to hear what he had done at school.
“(b) I am so proud of you, Steven,” he said.
Then, without a word, he handed Steven two Ace Amusement Park tickets and winked.(C)“If I don’t tell Stephanie, perhaps she will never know,” Steven thought for a moment.
He remembered that the winner would only be notified by mail.
As long as he kept quiet, nobody would know.
So he decided to sleep on it.
The next morning, he felt miserable and his dad recognized it right away.
“What’s wrong, (c) Son” asked his dad.
Steven was hesitant at first but soon disclosed his secret.
After listening attentively to the end, his dad advised him to do the right thing.(D)Reading on, Steven realized the letter had been delivered mistakenly.
“Unfortunately,” it should have gone to Stephanie, who was the real winner.
(d) He looked at the tickets and then the letter.
He had really wanted those tickets.
He had planned to go there with his younger sister.
Steven was his sister’s hero, and he had bragged to her that he would win the contest.
However, if she found out that her hero hadn’t won, she would be terribly disappointed, and (e) he would feel ashamed.
