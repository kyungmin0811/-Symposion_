When people expect to see someone again, they are more likely to find that person attractive, regardless of the individual’s behavior, than if they do not have expectations of future interaction.
The expectation of future interaction motivates people to look for positive qualities in someone so that they will look forward to future interactions rather than dread them, and increases the chances that people will find the individual attractive.
Conversely, when people interact with someone whom they do not foresee meeting again, they have little reason to search for positive qualities.
In fact, doing so may be depressing, given that they may not have the opportunity to get to know the person better in future interactions.
Indeed, people are sometimes motivated to find negative qualities in individuals whom they do not expect to see again.

Lone animals rely on their own senses to defend themselves, but an animal in a group benefits by having a lot of other animals’ eyes, ears, and noses on the alert for danger.
An animal in a group also has a smaller chance of being the unlucky individual picked out by a predator.
In addition, a group of animals fleeing from a predator can create confusion.
This makes it harder for a predator to focus on one animal to catch.
A school of fish will split in two to avoid a predator and then quickly regroup behind it.
A herd of zebras can become a dazzling display of black and white stripes, making it more difficult for a lion to see where one zebra ends and another begins.

It is fruitless to look at condominiums when you have spent the past odd years in a large house and then try to move all of your life into the smaller investment.
To do so often leads to frustration because what you wind up purchasing is an expensive warehouse for your furniture, and that is usually the wrong investment.
If you want to change your lifestyle, you must accept the consequences of that decision.

Occasionally, there are children who have trouble understanding that their clothing choice is inappropriate or even unhealthy.
Some children follow the suggestion that sandals may not be the best option for a snowy day.
For those kids, experience may be the best teacher.
For example, when Lydia was eight years old, she insisted on wearing her favorite sandals to school despite warnings that the sidewalks were covered in snow and slush.
Her mom worried that she would arrive at school with cold, wet feet, but Lydia would not change her mind.
Of course, her mother was right.
While Lydia did have some very uncomfortable toes because they became soaked and frozen on her way to and from school, she learned that sometimes fashion isn’t worth the price of serious discomfort.

Kate ran to the mailbox as soon as the mail truck drove away.
She opened the mailbox and reached into the dark space.
Her hope quickly disappeared, however.
There was nothing addressed to her.
It was her sixteenth birthday today, but there wasn’t even a birthday card from her father.
“I didn’t get anything from Dad,” said Kate to her mother.
“I can’t believe he forgot my birthday.” Kate’s father was a doctor, and every summer he went to Africa to treat people who were too poor to go to a hospital.
“Well, he didn’t forget your birthday, Kate.
I was going to give this to you at your birthday party this afternoon,” said her mother, giving her a small pink box with a purple ribbon, which arrived from Africa the day before.
“Yeah, I knew Dad wouldn’t let me down” shouted Kate, smiling the sweetest smile.

Do you remember the childlike joy you felt the last time you found a parking spot at the mall on a crowded day When you finished shopping, you may have left the spot with a certain hesitation, particularly if someone else was waiting for it.
Studies have shown that people take longer to leave a parking spot when another driver is waiting, even though they predict they will not.
It’s as if the space suddenly becomes more valuable once another person wants it.
Strictly speaking, it is no longer valuable to the person leaving it.
After all, it seems that our brains are sothat once we have been given something, we are hesitant to give it up.

Power walking is a type of exercise that nearly anyone can do.
Many people enjoy this form of exercise because it can be done outdoors in fresh air where the scenery can be changed by altering the course of the walk.
Alternatively, the exercise may be done indoors, in a climatecontrolled environment, on a treadmill.
People should start with a short distance on flat ground and gradually increase the distance and intensity.
Instruct people to sit on the bench and to start reading their newspapers carefully.
While power walking, people should wear shoes with a good arch support to avoid injury and wear clothes appropriate for the climate.

Effective communication is vital to achieving wellness because our daily interactions with others are important factors in our emotional health.
People who have developed a high degree of communication skills are more likely to have the potential for deeper bonds in their personal relationships than noncommunicators.
Perhaps the greatest communication satisfaction comes from our close relationships, which are the main source of our emotional health.
Close relationships develop when two people can exchange emotional messages easily and effectively.
Whether we develop effective communication skills that promote healthy interactions depends largely on how we learn to communicate.
For example, interaction between parents and their children is often important in determining whether a child is shy or unafraid of interaction.
Good parents listen to their children and allow them to talk about their fears and unhappiness.
Children raised in households that  communication find it easier to talk to others about their disappointments, fears, frustrations, and other emotions later in life.
Such individuals find that they ultimately have better emotional health.
