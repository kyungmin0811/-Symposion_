Dear staff,Next Monday, Nature’s Beauty Gardens will have the pleasure of hosting very important guests for the annual “Toddler Trek” event.
We hope that this will be fun, educational, and most importantly safe for the toddlers.
Parents and children are going to spend time enjoying outdoor activities and having a picnic lunch.
It is therefore very important to check the garden for potential dangers.
Managers of each department must make sure that all dangerous equipment and machinery are safely stored.
Also, for the safety of our guests at this event, garden chemicals will not be used anywhere in Nature’s Beauty Gardens.
Thank you for your cooperation in this safety check and for helping to make this year’s “Toddler Trek” event the best one yet.Best regards,Laura Alfaro, Managing Director

“Regularity is the key to mastery, Jean.
Everything other than that is a waste of time,” stressed Ms.
Baker, Jean’s piano teacher, with a troubled look.
However, Jean complained quite often about practicing and slipped out of her sessions occasionally.
Concerned about Jean idling around, Ms.
Baker decided to change her teaching method.
“You can make your own schedule, Jean.
However, I want you to help me as an assistant,” said Ms.
Baker.
After that, Jean practiced hard to be a good example to the beginners and her skills improved incredibly day after day.
The change in Jean was miraculous.
A smile came over Ms.
Baker’s face as she listened to Jean play.
Ms.
Baker was convinced by Jean’s improvement that her new teaching method was a success.

We say to ourselves “There is plenty of time.
I’ll manage somehow or other when the time comes for action.” We are rather proud of our ability to meet emergencies.
So we do not plan and take precautions to prevent emergencies from arising.
It is too easy to drift through school and college, taking the traditional, conventional studies that others take, following the lines of least resistance, electing “snap courses,” and going with the crowd.
It is too easy to take the attitude “First I will get my education and develop myself, and then I will know better what I am fitted to do for a life work.” And so we drift, driven by the winds of circumstance, tossed about by the waves of tradition and custom.
Eventually, most men find they must be satisfied with “any port in a storm.” Sailors who select a port because they are driven to it have scarcely one chance in a thousand of dropping anchor in the right one.

Internet entrepreneurs are creating jobsearch products and bringing them online regularly.
Within the past few years, new Internetbased businesses have come online that help people find internships, complete online classes tailored to individual employer job applications, or find volunteer work that will lead to fulltime employment.
Job mastery will mean keeping up with the rapidly evolving tools available on the Internet.
It should be noted, though, that no development in the Internet job age has reduced the importance of the most basic job search skill selfknowledge.
Even in the Internet age, the job search starts with identifying individual job skills, sector interests, and preferred workplace environment and interests.
Richard Bolles’ best selling job search book, first published in , had as its central theme the selfinventory of skills and workplace preferences.
This selfinventory continues to be the starting point for any job search today no matter what the Internet technology involved.

The term “biological control” has been used, at times, in a broad context to cover a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based products.
This has been spectacularly successful in many instances, with a number of pest problems permanently resolved by importation and successful establishment of natural enemies.
These importation successes have been limited largely to certain types of ecosystems andor pest situations such as introduced pests in perennial ecosystems.
On the other hand, this approach has met with limited success for major pests of row crops or other ephemeral systems.
In these situations, the problem is often not the lack of effective natural enemies but management practices and a lack of concerted research on factors that determine the success or failure of importation attempts in the specific agroecosystem setting.
Thus, importation programs, to date, are largely a matter of trial and error based on experience of the individual specialists involved.

According to the individualist form of rhetoric about science, still much used for certain purposes, discoveries are made in laboratories.
They are the product of inspired patience, of skilled hands and an inquiring but unbiased mind.
Moreover, they speak for themselves, or at least they speak too powerfully and too insistently for prejudiced humans to silence them.
It would be wrong to suppose that such beliefs are not sincerely held, yet almost nobody thinks they can provide a basis for action in public contexts.
Any scientist who announces a socalled discovery at a press conference without first permitting expert reviewers to examine his or her claims is automatically castigated as a publicity seeker.
The norms of scientific communication presuppose that nature does not speak unambiguously, and that knowledge isn’t knowledge unless it has been authorized by disciplinary specialists.
A scientific truth has little standing until it becomes a collective product.
What happens in somebody’s laboratory is only one stage in its construction.

Humans are so averse to feeling that they’re being cheated that they often respond in ways that seemingly make little sense.
Behavioral economists ― the economists who actually study what people do as opposed to the kind who simply assume the human mind works like a calculator ― have shown again and again that people reject unfair offers even if it costs them money to do so.
The typical experiment uses a task called the ultimatum game.
It’s pretty straightforward.
One person in a pair is given some money ― say .
She then has the opportunity to offer some amount of it to her partner.
The partner only has two options.
He can take what’s offered or refused to take anything.
There’s no room for negotiation; that’s why it’s called the ultimatum game.
What typically happens Many people offer an equal split to the partner, leaving both individuals happy and willing to trust each other in the future.

Here’s an interesting thought.
If glaciers started reforming, they have a great deal more water now to draw on ― Hudson Bay, the Great Lakes, the hundreds of thousands of lakes of Canada, none of which existed to fuel the last ice sheet ― so they would grow very much quicker.
And if they did start to advance again, what exactly would we do Blast them with TNT or maybe nuclear missiles Well, doubtless we would, but consider this.
In , the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America rocked Alaska with , megatons of concentrated might, the equivalent of , nuclear bombs.

Although prices in most retail outlets are set by the retailer, this does not mean that these prices .
On any particular day we find that all products have a specific price ticket on them.
However, this price may be different from day to day or week to week.
The price that the farmer gets from the wholesaler is much more flexible from day to day than the price that the retailer charges consumers.
If, for example, bad weather leads to a poor potato crop, then the price that supermarkets have to pay to their wholesalers for potatoes will go up and this will be reflected in the prices they mark on potatoes in their stores.
Thus, these prices do reflect the interaction of demand and supply in the wider marketplace for potatoes.
Although they do not change in the supermarket from hour to hour to reflect local variations in demand and supply, they do change over time to reflect the underlying conditions of the overall production of and demand for the goods in question.

While being an introvert comes with its challenges, it definitely has its advantages as well.
For example, an introvert is far less likely to make a mistake in a social situation, such as inadvertently insulting another person whose opinion is not agreeable.
An introvert would enjoy reflecting on their thoughts, and thus would be far less likely to suffer from boredom without outside stimulation.
The only risk that you will face as an introvert is that people who do not know you may think that you are aloof or that you think you are better than them.
If you learn how to open up just a little bit with your opinions and thoughts, you will be able to thrive in both worlds.
An introvert may prefer online to inperson communication, as you do when feeling temporarily uncertain with your relationships.
You can then stay true to your personality without appearing to be antisocial.

 A carbon sink is a natural feature that absorbs or stores more carbon than it releases.
(A) Carbon sinks have been able to absorb about half of this excess CO, and the world’s oceans have done the major part of that job.
They absorb about onefourth of humans’ industrial carbon emissions, doing half the work of all Earth’s carbon sinks combined.(B) Its mass of plants and other organic material absorb and store tons of carbon.
However, the planet’s major carbon sink is its oceans.
Since the Industrial Revolution began in the eighteenth century, CO released during industrial processes has greatly increased the proportion of carbon in the atmosphere.
(C) The value of carbon sinks is that they can help create equilibrium in the atmosphere by removing excess CO.
One example of a carbon sink is a large forest.

.There is a considerable difference as to whether people watch a film about the Himalayas on television and become excited by the ‘untouched nature’ of the majestic mountain peaks, or whether they get up and go on a trek to Nepal.Tourism takes place simultaneously in the realm of the imagination and that of the physical world.
In contrast to literature or film, it leads to ‘real’, tangible worlds, while nevertheless remaining tied to the sphere of fantasies, dreams, wishes ― and myth.
It thereby allows the ritual enactment of mythological ideas.
( ) Even in the latter case, they remain, at least partly, in an imaginary world.
( ) They experience moments that they have already seen at home in books, brochures and films.
( ) Their notions of untouched nature and friendly, innocent indigenous people will probably be confirmed.
( ) But now this confirmation is anchored in a physical experience.
( ) The myth is thus transmitted in a much more powerful way than by television, movies or books.
indigenous .There are also clinical cases that show the flip side of this coin.
Humans can tell lies with their faces.
Although some are specifically trained to detect lies from facial expressions, the average person is often misled into believing false and manipulated facial emotions.
One reason for this is that we are “twofaced.” By this I mean that we have two different neural systems that manipulate our facial muscles.
( ) One neural system is under voluntary control and the other works under involuntary control.
( ) There are reported cases of individuals who have damaged the neural system that controls voluntary expressions.
( ) They still have facial expressions, but are incapable of producing deceitful ones.
( ) The emotion that you see is the emotion they are feeling, since they have lost the needed voluntary control to produce false facial expressions.
( ) These people have injured the system that controls their involuntary expressions, so that the only changes in their demeanor you will see are actually willed expressions.

In some subject areas, topics build on one another in a hierarchical fashion, so that a learner must almost certainly master one topic before moving to the next.
For example, an elementary school student should probably master principles of addition before moving to multiplication, because multiplication is an extension of addition.
Similarly, a medical student must have expertise in human anatomy before studying surgical techniques It’s difficult to perform an appendectomy if you can’t find the appendix.
Vertical transfer refers to such situations A learner acquires new knowledge or skills by building on more basic information and procedures.
In other cases, knowledge of one topic may affect learning a second topic even though the first isn’t a necessary condition for the second.
Knowledge of French isn’t essential for learning Spanish, yet knowing French can help with Spanish because many words are similar in the two languages.
When knowledge of the first topic is helpful but not essential to learning the second one, lateral transfer is occurring.

By the turn of the twentieth century, the permanent repertoire of musical classics dominated almost every field of concert music, from piano, song, or chamber music recitals to operas and orchestral concerts.
The (a) change from a century before was enormous.
In the eighteenth century, performers and listeners demanded new music all the time, and “ancient music” included anything written more than twenty years earlier.
But musicians and audiences in the early s (b) expected that most concert music they performed or heard would be at least a generation old, and they judged new music by the standards of the classics already enshrined in the repertoire.
In essence, concert halls and opera houses had become museums for displaying the musical artworks of the past two hundred years.
The repertoire varied according to the performing medium and from region to region, but the core was largely the (c) same throughout most of Europe and the Americas, including operas and operatic excerpts from Mozart through Verdi, Wagner, and Bizet; orchestral and chamber music from Haydn through the late Romantics; and keyboard music by J.

Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and prominent nineteenthcentury composers.Living composers increasingly found themselves in competition with the music of the past.
This is the great theme of modern music in the classical tradition, especially in the first half of the century in competing with past composers for the attention of performers and listeners who (d) disregarded the classical masterworks, living composers sought to secure a place for themselves by offering something new and distinctive while continuing the tradition.
They combined individuality and innovation with emulation of the past, seeking to write music that would be considered original and worthy of performance alongside the masterworks of (e) earlier times.

The two were always together and within arm’s reach.
The only time they were apart was when Rita was learning to swim.
Princess had a fear of water that was so extreme that she couldn’t even touch the water.
 Boxer (  )(B)Upon hearing Rita’s cry, her mother rushed to the railing, shouting for help, from the entrance of the store a hundred feet or so away.
Princess was looking at the water and trembling in fear.

Her love for Rita overpowered her fear and she leapt out through the same open space in the railing and plunged into the water.
Once in the water, Princess quickly found Rita and slowly dragged her to the shore to her grateful mother.(C)Princess’ fears stemmed from her puppyhood when (c) she almost drowned twice.

While her mother headed to a store, Rita and Princess began to play on the boardwalk.
Suddenly, a boy riding a bicycle slipped on the damp wooden surface, hitting Rita at an angle, which propelled her through an open section of the guard rail.
