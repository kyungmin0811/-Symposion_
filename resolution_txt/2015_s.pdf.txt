One difference between winners and losers is how they handle losing.
 Even for the best companies and most accomplished professionals, long track records of success are punctuated by slips, slides, and miniturnarounds.
 Even the team that wins the game might make mistakes and lag behind for part of it.
 Thats why the ability to recover quickly is so important.
 Troubles are ubiquitous.
 Surprises can fall from the sky like volcanic ash and appear to change everything.
 Thats why one prominent scholar said, Anything can look like a failure in the middle.
 Thus, a key factor in high achievement is bouncing back from the low points.

 Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the doing than by mere abstract study.
 This is often the case with the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical disciplines.
 For example, within the philosophical disciplines, logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual problem solving.
 Only after some time and struggle does the student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of thinking.
 This learning by doing is essential in many of the sciences.
 For instance, only after a good deal of observation do the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the specific movements of identifiable particles.

 The most normal and competent child encounters what seem like insurmountable problems in living.
 But by playing them out, he may become able to cope with them in a stepbystep process.
 He often does so in symbolic ways that are hard for even him to understand, as he is reacting to inner processes whose origin may be buried deep in his unconscious.
 This may result in play that makes little sense to us at the moment, since we do not know the purposes it serves.
 When there is no immediate danger, it is usually best to approve of the childs play without interfering.

 At some time in their lives, most people pause to reflect on their own moral principles and on the practical implications of those principles, and they sometimes think about what principles people should have or which moral standards can be best justified.
 When a person accepts a moral principle, naturally the person believes the principle is important and well justified.
 But there is more to moral principles than that.
 When a principle is part of a persons moral code, that person is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that principle.
 The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of others whose behavior conflicts with it.
 Likewise, the person will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an abundance of the motivation required by the principle.

 The key to successful risk taking is to understand that the actions youre taking should be the natural next step.
 One of the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation is our tendency to focus on the end result.
 Skiers who are unsure of themselves often do this.
 Theyll go to the edge of a difficult slope, look all the way down to the bottom, and determine that the slope is too steep for them to try.
 The ones that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what they need to do to master the first step, like getting through the first mogul on the hill.
 Once they get there, they concentrate on the next mogul, and over the course of the run, they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an impossible mountain.

The th century is called the Golden Age of botanical painting, and Georg Dionysius Ehret is often praised as the greatest botanical artist of the time.
 Born in Heidelberg, Germany, he was the son of a gardener who taught him much about art and nature.
 As a young man, Ehret traveled around Europe, largely on foot, observing plants and developing his artistic skills.
 In Holland, he became acquainted with the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus.
 Through his collaborations with Linnaeus and others, Ehret provided illustrations for a number of significant horticultural publications.
 Ehrets reputation for scientific accuracy gained him many commissions from wealthy patrons, particularly in England, where he eventually settled.

 During the early stages when the aquaculture industry was rapidly expanding, mistakes were made and these were costly both in terms of direct losses and in respect of the industrys image.
 Highdensity rearing led to outbreaks of infectious diseases that in some cases devastated not just the caged fish, but local wild fish populations too.
 The negative impact on local wildlife inhabiting areas close to the fish farms continues to be an ongoing public relations problem for the industry.
 Furthermore, a general lack of knowledge and insufficient care being taken when fish pens were initially constructed meaning that pollution from excess feed and fish waste created huge barren underwater deserts.
 These were costly lessons to learn, but now stricter regulations are in place to ensure that fish pens are placed in sites where there is good water flow to remove fish waste.
 This, in addition to other methods that decrease the overall amount of uneaten food, has helped aquaculture to clean up its act.

Nancy was struggling to see the positive when her teen daughter was experiencing a negative perspective on her life and abilities.
 In her desire to parent intentionally, she went into her daughters room and noted one positive accomplishment she had observed.
 I know youve been having a hard time lately, and you arent feeling really good or positive about your life.
 But you did a great job cleaning up your room today, and I know that must have been a big effort for you.
 The next day, to Nancys surprise, the teen girl seemed somewhat cheerful.
 In passing, she said, Mom, thanks for saying the positive thing about me yesterday.
 I was feeling so down and couldnt think of anything good about myself.
 After you said that positive thing, it helped me see one good quality in myself, and Ive been holding onto those words.

 The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has been studied by psychologists since the s, but the term multitasking didnt exist until the s.
 It was used to describe computers, not people.
 Back then, ten megahertz was so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computers ability to quickly perform many tasks.
 In retrospect, they probably made a poor choice, for the expression multitasking is inherently deceptive.
 Multitasking is about multiple tasks alternately sharing one resource the CPU, but in time the context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple tasks being done simultaneously by one resource a person.
 It was a clever turn of phrase thats misleading, for even computers can process only one piece of code at a time.
 When they multitask, they switch back and forth, alternating their attention until both tasks are done.
 The speed with which computers tackle multiple tasksthat everything happens at the same time, so comparing computers to humans can be confusing.

 My friend was disappointed that scientific progress has not cured the worlds ills by abolishing wars and starvation that gross human inequality is still widespread that happiness is not universal.
 My friend made a common mistake  a basic misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge.
 Knowledge is amoral  not immoral but morality neutral.
 It can be used for any purpose, but many people assume it will be used to further their favorite hopes for society and this is the fundamental flaw.
 Knowledge of the world is one thing its uses create a separate issue.
 To be disappointed that our progress in understanding has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate view, but.
 To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point.
 There is nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social or moral application.
 to confuse this with the progress of knowledge is absurdto know the nature of knowledge is to practice its moral valueto remove social inequality is the inherent purpose of knowledgeto accumulate knowledge is to enhance its social applicationto make science progress is to make it cure social ills     .

 According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the size and complexity of human populations was the driving force in the evolution of science.
 Early, small communities had to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival their thoughts were focused on food and religion.
 As communities became larger, some people had time to reflect and debate.
 They found that they could understand and predict events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing these with observation and inference.
 But while a large population may have been necessary, in itself it was not sufficient for science to germinate.
 Some empires were big, but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to reason.

 A currently popular attitude is to blame technology or technologists for having brought on the environmental problems we face today, and thus to try to slow technological advance by blocking economic growth.
 We believe this view to be thoroughly misguided.
 If technology produced automobiles that pollute the air, it is because pollution was not recognized as a problem which engineers had to consider in their designs.
 Solar energy can be a practical alternative energy source for us in the foreseeable future.
 Obviously, technology that produces pollution is generally cheaper, but now that it has been decided that cleaner cars are wanted, less polluting cars will be produced cars which scarcely pollute at all could even be made.
 This last option, however, would require several years and much investment.
 Although technology is responsive to the will of the people, it can seldom respond instantaneously and is never free.

The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots the insects fed were exposed.
 Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued researchers, and it has always been assumed that the insects must rely on an internal clock.
 Recently, however, one group of scientists working with the year cicada in California have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that they can count.
   For their experiments they took yearold nymphs and moved them to an experimental enclosure.
   These nymphs should have taken a further two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one year.
   By doing this, the trees were tricked into flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once.
    Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on.
   So it seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the peaks.

  They also rated how generally extroverted those fake extroverts appeared, based on their recorded voices and body language.
Some years ago, a psychologist named Richard Lippa called a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like extroverts while pretending to teach a math class.
   Then he and his team, with video cameras in hand, measured the length of their strides, the amount of eye contact they made with their students, the percentage of time they spent talking, and the volume of their speech.
   Then Lippa did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the results.
   He found that although the latter group came across as more extroverted, some of the fake extroverts were surprisingly convincing.
   It seems that most of us know how to fake it to some extent.
   Whether or not were aware that the length of our strides and the amount of time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and extroverts, we know it unconsciously.

Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly established that certain works have certain effects.
 Plato is sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us cowardly the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress such representations.
 Tolstoy is confident that the artist who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those feelings on to us we can no more escape than we could escape an infectious disease.
 In fact, however, the effects of art are neither so certain nor so direct.
 People vary a great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and in the form which that response takes.

Increased size affects group life in a number of ways.
 There is evidence that larger groups five or six members are more productive than smaller groups two or three members.
 Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach less agreement, they also show less tension.
 These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems.
 Members may realize that their behavior must become more goaldirected, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so.
 Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform.
 In such groups, it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions.
There is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members.
 The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result.
 Groups with an even number of members may split into halves.
 This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members  one side always has a numerical advantage.

 Mr.
 Wills is Jeremy Wills, and a he is one of my former students.
 A few years back, he took my positive psychology class in college.
BBefore long, the reality hit Jeremy hard.
 Even after spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans, it became clear that his methods were not working.
 One of the worst moments was when b he distributed a math test.
 Many students didnt even look at the exam.
 They just put their heads on their desks and slept.
 Jeremy became so stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom.
CAfter graduation, Jeremy joined an organization that recruits future leaders to teach in lowincome communities.
 c He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county in North Carolina.
 Later, his assistant principal took note of Jeremys high expectations and asked him to take over d his math class.
 He took charge of about a dozen failing special ed kids, and Tisha and Kelly were among them.
 His idealism ran high, and he thought he would be able to magically fix all of their problems.
DJeremy knew something had to change.
 e He then thought back to my class, remembering how negative emotions can drag you down, leaving positive emotions unnoticed.
 Thats when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes within the classroom.
 He borrowed lessons from my positive psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students.
 As the students attitudes became more optimistic, their confidence with math grew too.
 At the end of the school year,  percent of Jeremys students passed the states math test.
