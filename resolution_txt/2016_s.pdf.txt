Im leaving early tomorrow morning, finally Ive always wanted to explore the Amazon, the unknown and mysterious world.
 At this hour, the great Emerald Amazon Explorer should be at the port waiting for me to get on board.
 Freshwater dolphins will escort me on the playful river, and  species of birds, half a dozen species of monkeys, and numerous colorful butterflies will welcome me into their kingdom.
 I wish I could camp in the wild and enjoy the company of mosquitos, snakes, and spiders.
 Id love to make the worlds largest rainforest home.
 My heart swells as much as my chubby bags yet, Id better get some sleep since a long, tough journey is ahead of me.

 Assertiveness may seem to some people to be uncharacteristic of counselors.
 If your picture of a counselor is someone who never disagrees, always goes along, wants everything to be nice all the time, and only does what other people want him or her to do, this is not a picture of an assertive counselor.
 Being assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable.
 Being a counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent when someone tells a racist joke.
 An assertive counselor would find a way to call that persons attention to the fact that the joke is racist, explaining how it offended the hearer, and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided.
 Being assertive is a highly developed skill  it should fit nicely in the counselors repertoire of techniques.

Dear Coach Johnson,My name is Christina Markle, Bradley Markles mother.
 Bradley and I were thrilled to learn that youre holding your Gymnastics Summer Camp again this year.
 So I didnt hesitate to sign up and pay the nonrefundable deposit for the second week program, which is from July  to .
 But today I remembered that our family is going to get back from a trip on July , and Im afraid Bradley wont be able to make it on the very first day of the program.
 Rather than make him skip the day, Id like to check to see if he could switch to the third week program.
 Please let us know if thats possible.
 Thank you.
Sincerely,Christina Markle     .

The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades have been documented with students from different cultures.
 Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning, we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather than extrinsic.
 Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward.
 Since there are three decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse students.

 Twin sirens hide in the sea of history, tempting those seeking to understand and appreciate the past onto the reefs of misunderstanding and misinterpretation.
 These twin dangers are temporocentrism and ethnocentrism.
 Temporocentrism is the belief that your times are the best of all possible times.
 All other times are thus inferior.
 Ethnocentrism is the belief that your culture is the best of all possible cultures.
 All other cultures are thus inferior.
 Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other individuals and cultures by the superior standards of their current culture.
 This leads to a total lack of perspective when dealing with past and  or foreign cultures and a resultant misunderstanding and misappreciation of them.

When we remark with surprise that someone looks young for his or her chronological age, we are observing that we all age biologically at different rates.
 Scientists have good evidence that this apparent difference is real.
 It is likely that age changes begin in different parts of the body at different times and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells, tissues, and organs, as well as from person to person.
 Unlike the passage of time, biological aging resists easy measurement.
 What we would like to have is one or a few measurable biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes without reference to the passage of time, so that we could say, for example, that someone who is chronologically eighty years old is biologically sixty years old.
 This kind of measurement would help explain why one eightyyearold has so many more youthful qualities than does another eightyyearold, who may be biologically eighty or even ninety years old.

 Protogenes       .
Known for his devotion to each of his paintings, Protogenes was an ancient Greek painter and a rival of Apelles.
 He was born in Caunus, on the coast of Caria, but lived most of his life in Rhodes.
 Little else is known of him.
 But there are some accounts of his paintings.
 The Ialysus and the Satyr were the most wellknown among his works.
 Protogenes spent approximately seven years painting the Ialysus, a depiction of a local hero of a town in Rhodes.
 After remaining in Rhodes for at least  years, it was carried off to Rome.
 There later it was destroyed by fire.
 Protogenes worked on the Satyr during Demetrius Poliorcetes attack on Rhodes from  to  B.
C.
 Interestingly, the garden in which he painted the Satyr was in the middle of the enemys camp.
 Protogenes is said to have been about seventy years of age when the Satyr was completed.

 The Greeks focus on the salient object and its attributes led to their failure to understand the fundamental nature of causality.
 Aristotle explained that a stone falling through the air is due to the stone having the property of gravity.
 But of course a piece of wood tossed into water floats instead of sinking.
 This phenomenon Aristotle explained as being due to the wood having the property of levity In both cases the focus is exclusively on the object, with no attention paid to the possibility that some force outside the object might be relevant.
 But the Chinese saw the world as consisting of continuously interacting substances, so their attempts to understand it causing them to be oriented toward the complexities of the entire field, that is, the context or environment as a whole.
 The notion that events always occur in a field of forces would have been completely intuitive to the Chinese.

The dancers stood on a twostep elevated stage, so that there was a natural gap between those who came to dance and those who came to watch.
 The host randomly pulled the name of a wellknown dancer, Linx, out of a hat.
 People cheered.
 According to the format, Linx had to call out another dancer to battle him on stage.
 Instead of deliberately choosing someone, however, he decided to select his opponent randomly by making himself into a human spinwheel.
 He propelled himself into a backspin, covered his eyes, and extended his arm above his head.
 When his body finally stopped spinning, his arm pointed away from the dancers on stage and directly at Dan Tres, standing among the spectators.
 The crowd erupted in Ohhhhs because he was an older family man who had not danced hiphop in many years, while the much younger Linx was a nimble bboy.
 Linx looked embarrassed, but nonetheless he called out the respected elder to battle.

 When two cultures come into contact, they do not exchange every cultural item.
 If that were the case, there would be no cultural differences in the world today.
 Instead, only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from one culture to another.
 Which cultural item is accepted depends largely on the items use and compatibility with already existing cultural traits.
 For example, it is not likely that mens hair dyes designed to get out the gray will spread into parts of rural Africa where a persons status is elevated with advancing years.

 Research and development for seed improvement has long been a public domain and government activity for the common good.

 This process gained pace after the invention of hybrid breeding of maize in the late s.

 For instance, a child who has been repeatedly criticized for poor performance on math may learn to dodge difficult math problems in order to avoid further punishment.
B Unfortunately, because of this avoidance, the child fails to develop his math skills and therefore improve the capabilities he has, and so a vicious cycle has set in.

Food intake is essential for the survival of every living organism.

 Therefore, it is not surprising that humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality.
 A first judgment about the value of a food source is made on its appearance and smell.
 Food that looks and smells attractive is taken into the mouth.
 The value of a particular food is an estimation of how good it is, based on its level of vitamins, minerals, or calories.
 Here, based on a complex sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste but also includes smell, touch, and hearing, the final decision whether to swallow or reject food is made.
 Frequently, this complex interaction between different senses is inappropriately referred to as taste although it should be better called flavor perception, because it uses multiple senses.

 Youre all grownup, she whispered.
 Hannah took more photos with her teachers in the school garden.
 She wished all the memories would remain in her mind forever.
CHannah struggled with the many class hours, the endless assignments, and the exams.
 However, there were exciting events like sports days and school festivals.
 How could c she ever forget her second year She had sung and danced with her friends in the festival, part of a sensational performance.
 After that, she had become more confident and active.
 Her thoughts wandering, Hannah vaguely heard her mothers voice.
 Here you are Her mother hurried over, and gave d her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug.
   DThat day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious were ahead.
 Hannah was nervous and trembling.
 The principal was energetically addressing them, talking of the challenges and thrills of high school life, but she could not concentrate.
 Later, a tall, strictlooking man introduced himself as e her homeroom teacher.
 The classroom was old, but neat and inviting.
 Hannah was seated in the fifth row, hallway side, even though she had wanted a window seat.
 High school life soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted.

  Surprised by the vision of an unfamiliar silhouette pushing into the house, these dogs were using their eyes instead of their noses.
 Remember when you were little and you imagined that adults had infinite power.
 Surely someone who could drive the car, open the juice container, and reach the sink could make it stop raining.
   I think thats the same expectation that we have with respect to our dogs and their ability to smell.
   Because they are so good at using their noses, we assume that they can smell anything, anytime.
   But dogs use other senses, too, and the brains of both humans and dogs tend to intensify one sense at a time.
   Many owners have been snapped at by their dogs when they returned home with a new hairdo or a new coat.
   Their noses may be remarkable, but theyre not always switched on.

  Even so, it is not the money per se that is valuable, but the fact that it can potentially yield more positive experiences.
Money  beyond the bare minimum necessary for food and shelter  is nothing more than a means to an end.
 Yet so often we confuse means with ends, and sacrifice happiness end for money means.
 It is easy to do this when material wealth is elevated to the position of the ultimate end, as it so often is in our society.
   This is not to say that the accumulation and production of material wealth is in itself wrong.
   Material prosperity can help individuals, as well as society, attain higher levels of happiness.
   Financial security can liberate us from work we do not find meaningful and from having to worry about the next paycheck.
   Moreover, the desire to make money can challenge and inspire us.
   Material wealth in and of itself does not necessarily generate meaning or lead to emotional wealth.

Food intake is essential for the survival of every living organism.
 The failure to detect spoiled or toxic food can have deadly consequences.
 Therefore, it is not surprising that humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality.
 A first judgment about the value of a food source is made on its appearance and smell.
 Food that looks and smells attractive is taken into the mouth.
 The value of a particular food is an estimation of how good it is, based on its level of vitamins, minerals, or calories.
 Here, based on a complex sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste but also includes smell, touch, and hearing, the final decision whether to swallow or reject food is made.
 Frequently, this complex interaction between different senses is inappropriately referred to as taste although it should be better called flavor perception, because it uses multiple senses.

Performance must be judged in terms of what is under the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than those influences on performance that are beyond their control.
 There can be broad, influential factors, sometimes of an economic nature, that hold down the performance of everyone being judged.
 One example is in sales.
 If there is a general downturn in the economy and products or services are not being purchased with the same frequency as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example, by an average of .
 This  actually  figure would then represent average performance.
 Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a  drop in sales over the previous year.
 Thus, good performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group.
In performance evaluation, we should consider A factors affecting the individuals performance rather than B figures only.

We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research.
 Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use.
 Of course, the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge.
 In the middle of the th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were.
 He answered, Madam, what good is a baby.
 Of course, Faradays experiments were the beginning of the electronic age.
 Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world  transistors, vaccines, plastics  began as basic research.
 Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems.
 Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional.
 Science is the study of nature, and as we learn more about how nature works, we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us.
 The seemingly  knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature.
 Science tells us where we are and what we are, and that knowledge is beyond value.
