I’m leaving early tomorrow morning, finally I’ve always wanted to explore the Amazon, the unknown and mysterious world.
At this hour, the great Emerald Amazon Explorer should be at the port waiting for me to get on board.
Freshwater dolphins will escort me on the playful river, and  species of birds, half a dozen species of monkeys, and numerous colorful butterflies will welcome me into their kingdom.
I wish I could camp in the wild and enjoy the company of mosquitos, snakes, and spiders.
I’d love to make the world’s largest rainforest home.
My heart swells as much as my chubby bags; yet, I’d better get some sleep since a long, tough journey is ahead of me.

Assertiveness may seem to some people to be uncharacteristic of counselors.
If your picture of a counselor is someone who never disagrees, always “goes along,” wants everything to be nice all the time, and only does what other people want him or her to do, this is not a picture of an assertive counselor.
Being assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable.
Being a counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent when someone tells a racist joke.
An assertive counselor would find a way to call that person’s attention to the fact that the joke is racist, explaining how it offended the hearer, and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided.
Being assertive is a highly developed skill ― it should fit nicely in the counselor’s repertoire of techniques.

The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades have been documented with students from different cultures.
Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning, we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather than extrinsic.
Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward.
Since there are three decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse students.

Twin sirens hide in the sea of history, tempting those seeking to understand and appreciate the past onto the reefs of misunderstanding and misinterpretation.
These twin dangers are temporocentrism and ethnocentrism.
Temporocentrism is the belief that your times are the best of all possible times.
All other times are thus inferior.
Ethnocentrism is the belief that your culture is the best of all possible cultures.
All other cultures are thus inferior.
Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other individuals and cultures by the “superior” standards of their current culture.
This leads to a total lack of perspective when dealing with past and  or foreign cultures and a resultant misunderstanding and misappreciation of them.
Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism tempt moderns into unjustified criticisms of the peoples of the past.

When we remark with surprise that someone “looks young” for his or her chronological age, we are observing that we all age biologically at different rates.
Scientists have good evidence that this apparent difference is real.
It is likely that age changes begin in different parts of the body at different times and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells, tissues, and organs, as well as from person to person.
Unlike the passage of time, biological aging resists easy measurement.
What we would like to have is one or a few measurable biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes without reference to the passage of time, so that we could say, for example, that someone who is chronologically eighty years old is biologically sixty years old.
This kind of measurement would help explain why one eightyyearold has so many more youthful qualities than does another eightyyearold, who may be biologically eighty or even ninety years old.

The above graph shows the results of a survey conducted in .
It compares the percentage of parents of minor children (hereafter, parents) and that of other adults in terms of their involvement in six library activities.
Most notably, the percentage of parents is higher than that of other adults in all activity types.
The percentage of parents who browsed shelves is the same as that of parents who borrowed print books.
The percentage gap between parents and other adults is largest in the activity of attending classes or events for children and is smallest in the activity of using computers or the Internet.
The percentage of other adults who browsed shelves is twice as high as that of other adults who borrowed DVDs, CDs, or videotapes.
Finally, the percentage of parents who borrowed ebooks is less than  but is higher than that of other adults who did the same activity.

Known for his devotion to each of his paintings, Protogenes was an ancient Greek painter and a rival of Apelles.
He was born in Caunus, on the coast of Caria, but lived most of his life in Rhodes.
Little else is known of him.
But there are some accounts of his paintings.
The Ialysus and the Satyr were the most wellknown among his works.
Protogenes spent approximately seven years painting the Ialysus, a depiction of a local hero of a town in Rhodes.
After remaining in Rhodes for at least  years, it was carried off to Rome.
There later it was destroyed by fire.
Protogenes worked on the Satyr during Demetrius Poliorcetes’ attack on Rhodes from  to  B.C.
Interestingly, the garden in which he painted the Satyr was in the middle of the enemy’s camp.
Protogenes is said to have been about seventy years of age when the Satyr was completed.

The Greeks’ focus on the salient object and its attributes led to their failure to understand the fundamental nature of causality.
Aristotle explained that a stone falling through the air is due to the stone having the property of “gravity.” But of course a piece of wood tossed into water floats instead of sinking.
This phenomenon Aristotle explained as being due to the wood having the property of “levity” In both cases the focus is exclusively on the object, with no attention paid to the possibility that some force outside the object might be relevant.
But the Chinese saw the world as consisting of continuously interacting substances, so their attempts to understand it causing them to be oriented toward the complexities of the entire “field,” that is, the context or environment as a whole.
The notion that events always occur in a field of forces would have been completely intuitive to the Chinese.

The Atitln Giant Grebe was a large, flightless bird that had evolved from the much more widespread and smaller Piedbilled Grebe.

One immediate reason was easy enough to spot the local human population was cutting down the reed beds at a furious rate.
This (A) accommodation  destruction was driven by the needs of a fast growing matmaking industry.
But there were other problems.
An American airline was intent on developing the lake as a tourist destination for fishermen.
However, there was a major problem with this idea the lake (B) lacked  supported any suitable sporting fish To compensate for this rather obvious defect, a specially selected species of fish called the Largemouthed Bass was introduced.

When two cultures come into contact, they do not exchange every cultural item.
If that were the case, there would be no cultural differences in the world today.
Instead, only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from one culture to another.
Which cultural item is accepted depends largely on the item’s use and compatibility with already existing cultural traits.
For example, it is not likely that men’s hair dyes designed to “get out the gray” will spread into parts of rural Africa where a person’s status is elevated with advancing years.
Even when a(n)  is consistent with a society’s needs, there is still no guarantee that it will be accepted.
For example, most people in the United States using US customary units (e.g., inch, foot, yard, mile, etc.) have resisted adopting the metric system even though making such a change would enable US citizens to interface with the rest of the world more efficiently.

.Some people make few intentional changes in life.
Sure, over time they may get fatter, gather lines, and go gray.

What is the difference between these two groups of people (B) But they wear their hair the same way, buy the same brand of shoes, eat the same breakfast, and stick to routines for no reason other than the ease of a comfortable, predictable life.
Yet as both research and real life show, many others do make important changes.(C) It’s their perspective.
People who change do not question whether change is possible or look for reasons they cannot change.
They simply decide on a change they want and do what is necessary to accomplish it.
Changing, which always stems from a firm decision, becomes job number one.

 Surprised by the vision of an unfamiliar silhouette pushing into the house, these dogs were using their eyes instead of their noses.
Remember when you were little and you imagined that adults had infinite power Surely someone who could drive the car, open the juice container, and reach the sink could make it stop raining.
( ) I think that’s the same expectation that we have with respect to our dogs and their ability to smell.
( ) Because they are so good at using their noses, we assume that they can smell anything, anytime.
( ) But dogs use other senses, too, and the brains of both humans and dogs tend to intensify one sense at a time.
( ) Many owners have been snapped at by their dogs when they returned home with a new hairdo or a new coat.
( ) Their noses may be remarkable, but they’re not always switched on..
 Even so, it is not the money per se that is valuable, but the fact that it can potentially yield more positive experiences.Money ― beyond the bare minimum necessary for food and shelter ― is nothing more than a means to an end.
Yet so often we confuse means with ends, and sacrifice happiness (end) for money (means).
It is easy to do this when material wealth is elevated to the position of the ultimate end, as it so often is in our society.
( ) This is not to say that the accumulation and production of material wealth is in itself wrong.
( ) Material prosperity can help individuals, as well as society, attain higher levels of happiness.
( ) Financial security can liberate us from work we do not find meaningful and from having to worry about the next paycheck.
( ) Moreover, the desire to make money can challenge and inspire us.
( ) Material wealth in and of itself does not necessarily generate meaning or lead to emotional wealth.

Food intake is essential for the survival of every living organism.
The failure to detect spoiled or toxic food can have deadly consequences.
Therefore, it is not surprising that humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality.
A first judgment about the value of a food source is made on its appearance and smell.
Food that looks and smells attractive is taken into the mouth.
The value of a particular food is an estimation of how good it is, based on its level of vitamins, minerals, or calories.
Here, based on a complex sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste but also includes smell, touch, and hearing, the final decision whether to swallow or reject food is made.
Frequently, this complex interaction between different senses is inappropriately referred to as ‘taste’ although it should be better called flavor perception, because it uses multiple senses.

Performance must be judged in terms of what is under the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than those influences on performance that are beyond their control.
There can be broad, influential factors, sometimes of an economic nature, that hold down the performance of everyone being judged.
One example is in sales.
If there is a general downturn in the economy and products or services are not being purchased with the same frequency as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example, by an average of .
This  (actually ) figure would then represent “average” performance.
Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a  drop in sales over the previous year.
Thus, “good” performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group.In performance evaluation, we should consider (A) factors affecting the individual’s performance rather than (B) figures only.(A)(B)

We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research.
Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use.
Of course, the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge.
In the middle of the th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were.
He answered, “Madam, what good is a baby” Of course, Faraday’s experiments were the beginning of the electronic age.
Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world ― transistors, vaccines, plastics ― began as basic research.
Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems.
Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional.
Science is the study of nature, and as we learn more about how nature works, we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us.
The seemingly  knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature.
Science tells us where we are and what we are, and that knowledge is beyond value.

(A)The midday sun was glorious.
The high school grounds were filled with welldressed people, posing in fancy dresses and suits for cheerful photographers.
Congratulations, hugs, and laughter were contagious.
Hannah looked at all the familiar faces that had been part of (a) her life for the last few years.
Soon her mother would be joining them.
She recalled the first day of school when she had stood in that same place, in the middle of many anxious freshmen, some of whom had become her closest friends.(B)“Hannah, you look so serious.
What are you thinking about” “Oh, Mom, just, you know.” Her mother smiled.
“You’ll miss this place, won’t you” Hannah nodded.
“Quick,” her mother said, “stand over there ...
and smile, Hannah.
You have such a pretty smile.” (b) She hurried out her cell phone, zoomed in on her daughter, and realized suddenly that she was looking at a young lady.
“You’re all grownup,” she whispered.
Hannah took more photos with her teachers in the school garden.
She wished all the memories would remain in her mind forever.(C)Hannah struggled with the many class hours, the endless assignments, and the exams.
However, there were exciting events like sports days and school festivals.
How could (c) she ever forget her second year She had sung and danced with her friends in the festival, part of a sensational performance.
After that, she had become more confident and active.
Her thoughts wandering, Hannah vaguely heard her mother’s voice.
“Here you are” Her mother hurried over, and gave (d) her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug.
  (D)That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious were ahead.
Hannah was nervous and trembling.
The principal was energetically addressing them, talking of the challenges and thrills of high school life, but she could not concentrate.
Later, a tall, strictlooking man introduced himself as (e) her homeroom teacher.
The classroom was old, but neat and inviting.
Hannah was seated in the fifth row, hallway side, even though she had wanted a window seat.
High school life soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted.
