Dear Mr.
AndersonMy name is Sophia Willis, Events Manager of the  Caroline County Art Contest.
I am currently looking for a place for this year’s contest exhibition.
The Caroline County Art Contest has had over one hundred artworks submitted to us by local artists.
For the theme, we wanted artists to explore the natural world of Caroline County.
I believe the Garden Caf Gallery would be a perfect place to host the event, as your gallery is wellknown for its beautiful garden.
The exhibition is usually held throughout October, and we very much hope that we can rent a space for the exhibition at the Garden Caf Gallery during this time.
I look forward to your response.
Yours sincerely,Sophia Willis

The day of the Five Mile Fun Walk had arrived.
Annette had been waiting for Reiner at the registration point for over an hour.
There was still no sign of him.
She started thinking that something bad might have happened to him.
Getting concerned, she tried calling Reiner’s phone again, but there was no response.
At that moment, she heard a voice calling her name.
She found Reiner coming toward her.
“Thank goodness What happened” she asked.
He explained that the traffic had been terrible.
What was worse, he had left his phone at home.
“I’m so sorry,” he said.
She started to relax.
“I’m fine now.
As long as you’re here and safe.
Why don’t we go and register” They headed into the event together.

Given the right conditions, entrepreneurship can be fully woven into the fabric of campus life, greatly expanding its educational reach.
One study showed that, within the workplace, peers influence each other to spot opportunities and act on them the more entrepreneurs you have working together in an office, the more likely their colleagues will catch the bug.
A study of Stanford University alumni found that those “who have varied work and educational backgrounds are much more likely to start their own businesses than those who have focused on one role at work or concentrated in one subject at school.” To cultivate an entrepreneurial culture, colleges and universities need to offer students a broad choice of experiences and wide exposure to different ideas.
They are uniquely positioned to do this by combining the resources of academic programming, residential life, student groups, and alumni networks.

By expecting what’s likely to happen next, you prepare for the few most likely scenarios so that you don’t have to figure things out while they’re happening.
It’s therefore not a surprise when a restaurant server offers you a menu.
When she brings you a glass with a clear fluid in it, you don’t have to ask if it’s water.
After you eat, you don’t have to figure out why you aren’t hungry anymore.
All these things are expected and are therefore not problems to solve.
Furthermore, imagine how demanding it would be to always consider all the possible uses for all the familiar objects with which you interact.
Should I use my hammer or my telephone to pound in that nail On a daily basis, functional fixedness is a relief, not a curse.
That’s why you shouldn’t even attempt to consider all your options and possibilities.
You can’t.
If you tried to, then you’d never get anything done.
So don’t knock the box.
Ironically, although it limits your thinking, it also makes you smart.
It helps you to stay one step ahead of reality.

Music is a human art form, an inseparable part of the human experience everywhere in the world.
Music is social, and tightly woven into the tapestry of life, and young children are very much a part of this multifaceted fabric.
The musical experiences they have provide opportunities for them to know language, behaviors, customs, traditions, beliefs, values, stories, and other cultural nuances.
As they become musically skilled through experiences in song and instrumental music, young children can also grow cultural knowledge and sensitivity.
Music is an extremely important aspect of culture, shaping and transmitting the abovementioned aspects that characterize groups of people.
Exposing young children to the world’s musical cultures brings them into the cultural conversation, allowing them to learn about self and others in an artistically meaningful and engaging way.
Prior to the development of social biases and cultural preferences that all too easily turn into prejudices, the opportunity to know people through song, dance, and instrument play is a gift to all who work for the wellbalanced development of young children into the responsible citizens they will one day become.

Conventional wisdom in the West, influenced by philosophers from Plato to Descartes, credits individuals and especially geniuses with creativity and originality.
Social and cultural influences and causes are minimized, ignored, or eliminated from consideration at all.
Thoughts, original and conventional, are identified with individuals, and the special things that individuals are and do are traced to their genes and their brains.
The “trick” here is to recognize that individual humans are social constructions themselves, embodying and reflecting the variety of social and cultural influences they have been exposed to during their lives.
Our individuality is not denied, but it is viewed as a product of specific social and cultural experiences.
The brain itself is a social thing, influenced structurally and at the level of its connectivities by social environments.
The “individual” is a legal, religious, and political fiction just as the “I” is a grammatical illusion.

The discovery that man’s knowledge is not, and never has been, perfectly accurate has had a humbling and perhaps a calming effect upon the soul of modern man.
The nineteenth century, as we have observed, was the last to believe that the world, as a whole as well as in its parts, could ever be perfectly known.
We realize now that this is, and always was, impossible.
We know within limits, not absolutely, even if the limits can usually be adjusted to satisfy our needs.
Curiously, from this new level of uncertainty even greater goals emerge and appear to be attainable.
Even if we cannot know the world with absolute precision, we can still control it.
Even our inherently incomplete knowledge seems to work as powerfully as ever.
In short, we may never know precisely how high is the highest mountain, but we continue to be certain that we can get to the top nevertheless.

Marc Isambard Brunel () is best known for the design and construction of the Thames Tunnel.
Originally born in France, Brunel escaped to the United States during the French Revolution.
He later moved to London.
When the Napoleonic Wars were at their height, he invented machines for making boots.
During the Napoleonic Wars, Brunel’s factory supplied British troops with boots.
After the Wars ended, however, the government stopped buying his boots and he went out of business.
A few years later, Brunel was imprisoned for several months because of his debt.
At that time, London was very much divided by the River Thames and needed more ways for people and goods to move across it.
In , Brunel designed a tunnel under the river.
The Thames Tunnel officially opened on  March , and Brunel, despite being in ill health, attended the opening ceremony.

Competitive activities can be more than just performance showcases which the best is recognized and the rest are overlooked.
The provision of timely, constructive feedback to participants on performance is an asset that some competitions and contests offer.
In a sense, all competitions give feedback.
For many, this is restricted to information about whether the participant is an award or prizewinner.
The provision of that type of feedback can be interpreted as shifting the emphasis to demonstrating superior performance but not necessarily excellence.
The best competitions promote excellence, not just winning or “beating” others.
The emphasis on superiority is what we typically see as fostering a detrimental effect of competition.
Performance feedback requires that the program go beyond the “win, place, or show” level of feedback.
Information about performance can be very helpful, not only to the participant who does not win or place but also to those who do.

If I say to you, ‘Don’t think of a white bear’, you will find it difficult not to think of a white bear.
In this way, ‘thought suppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to suppress instead of calming them’.
One common example of this is that people on a diet who try not to think about food often begin to think much more about food.
This process is therefore also known as the rebound effect.
The ironic effect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related cognitive processes.
This dualprocess system involves, first, an intentional operating process, which consciously attempts to locate thoughts unrelated to the suppressed ones.
Second, and simultaneously, an unconscious monitoring process tests whether the operating system is functioning effectively.
If the monitoring system encounters thoughts inconsistent with the intended ones, it prompts the intentional operating process to ensure that these are replaced by inappropriate thoughts.
However, it is argued, the intentional operating system can fail due to increased cognitive load caused by fatigue, stress and emotional factors, and so the monitoring process filters the inappropriate thoughts into consciousness, making them highly accessible.

“What’s in a name That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.” This thought of Shakespeare’s points up a difference between roses and, say, paintings.
Natural objects, such as roses, are not.
They are not taken as vehicles of meanings and messages.
They belong to no tradition, strictly speaking have no style, and are not understood within a framework of culture and convention.
Rather, they are sensed and savored relatively directly, without intellectual mediation, and so what they are called, either individually or collectively, has little bearing on our experience of them.
What a work of art is titled, on the other hand, has a significant effect on the aesthetic face it presents and on the qualities we correctly perceive in it.
A painting of a rose, by a name other than the one it has, might very well smell different, aesthetically speaking.
The painting titled Rose of Summer and an indiscernible painting titled Vermillion Womanhood are physically, but also semantically and aesthetically, distinct objects of art.

In a highly commercialized setting such as the United States, it is not surprising that many landscapes are seen as commodities.
In other words, they are valued because of their market potential.
Residents develop an identity in part based on how the landscape can generate income for the community.This process involves more than the conversion of the natural elements into commodities.
The landscape itself, including the people and their sense of self, takes on the form of a commodity.
Landscape protection in the US traditionally focuses on protecting areas of wilderness, typically in mountainous regions.
Over time, the landscape identity can evolve into a sort of “logo” that can be used to sell the stories of the landscape.
Thus, California’s “Wine Country,” Florida’s “Sun Coast,” or South Dakota’s “Badlands” shape how both outsiders and residents perceive a place, and these labels build a set of expectations associated with the culture of those who live there.

.In the fifth century B.C.E., the Greek philosopher Protagoras pronounced, “Man is the measure of all things.” In other words, we feel entitled to ask the world, “What good are you”(A) Abilities said to “make us human” ― empathy, communication, grief, toolmaking, and so on ― all exist to varying degrees among other minds sharing the world with us.
Animals with backbones (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) all share the same basic skeleton, organs, nervous systems, hormones, and behaviors.(B) We assume that we are the world’s standard, that all things should be compared to us.
Such an assumption makes us overlook a lot.(C) Just as different models of automobiles each have an engine, drive train, four wheels, doors, and seats, we differ mainly in terms of our outside contours and a few internal tweaks.
But like naive car buyers, most people see only animals’ varied exteriors.

Research from the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation in the USA shows that people feel that ‘materialism’ somehow comes between them and the satisfaction of their social needs.
A report entitled Yearning for Balance, based on a nationwide survey of Americans, concluded that they were ‘deeply ambivalent about wealth and material gain’.
A large majority of people wanted society to ‘move away from greed and excess toward a way of life more centred on values, community, and family’.
But they also felt that these priorities were not shared by most of their fellow Americans, who, they believed, had become ‘increasingly atomized, selfish, and irresponsible’.
As a result they often felt isolated.
However, the report says, that when brought together in focus groups to discuss these issues, people were ‘surprised and excited to find that others shared their views’.
Rather than uniting us with others in a common cause, the unease we feel about the loss of social values and the way we are drawn into the pursuit of material gain is often experienced as if it were a purely private ambivalence which cuts us off from others.

To the extent that sufficient context has been provided, the reader can come to a wellcrafted text with no expert knowledge and come away with a good approximation of what has been intended by the author.
The text has become a public document and the reader can read it with a (a) minimum of effort and struggle; his experience comes close to what Freud has described as the deployment of “evenlyhovering attention.” He puts himself in the author’s hands (some have had this experience with great novelists such as Dickens or Tolstoy) and he (b) follows where the author leads.
The real world has vanished and the fictive world has taken its place.
Now consider the other extreme.
When we come to a badly crafted text in which context and content are not happily joined, we must struggle to understand, and our sense of what the author intended probably bears (c) close correspondence to his original intention.
An outofdate translation will give us this experience; as we read, we must bring the language up to date, and understanding comes only at the price of a fairly intense struggle with the text.
Badly presented content with no frame of reference can provide (d) the same experience; we see the words but have no sense of how they are to be taken.
The author who fails to provide the context has (e) mistakenly assumed that his picture of the world is shared by all his readers and fails to realize that supplying the right frame of reference is a critical part of the task of writing.

They always gathered at this time of year to assist with her corn harvest.
In return, their grandmother would reward them with a present and by cooking a delicious feast.

But not Sally.
She disliked working in the corn field as she hated the heat and the dust.

(b) She had only filled her sack twice, but the others were now taking their third sacks to the granary.
Sally sighed heavily.
Then an idea struck her.
To make the sack lighter and speed things up, she quickly filled her last sack with corn stalks.
Sally reached the granary first, and her grandmother asked (c) her to put aside the final load and write her name on it.

After finishing, the children continued working until the sun was high and their sacks were bursting.
Each child had to make three trips to the granary.
Grandmother was impressed by their efforts and (d) she wanted to give them presents accordingly.(D)Grandmother asked the other children to do the same thing.
Then, all of the children enjoyed their grandmother’s delicious lunch.
“I am so pleased with your work,” she told them after lunch.
“This year, you can all take home your final load as a present” The children cheered for joy, gladly thanked her, and lifted their sacks to take home.
Sally was terribly disappointed.
There was nothing but useless corn stalks in (e) her sack.
She then made the long walk home, pretending that she was carrying a heavy load.
