All smiling, Breaden, a cute threeyearold boy, was walking along the aisle of snacks, bars, and sweets.
 It was the aisle of all kinds of temptation for him.
 Wow he exclaimed.
 Right in front of his eyes were rows of deliciouslooking chocolate bars waiting to be touched.
 His mom was holding his hand.
 Breaden, her only child, had always been the focus of her attention and she was cautious not to lose him in the market.
 Suddenly, she stopped to say hello to her friends.
 Breaden stopped, too.
 With his eyes wide open and his mouth watering, Breaden stretched out his arm and was about to grab a bar when he felt a tight grip on his hand.
 He looked up.

Many present efforts to guard and maintain human progress, to meet human needs, and to realize human ambitions are simply unsustainable in both the rich and poor nations.
 They draw too heavily, too quickly, on already overdrawn environmental resource accounts to be affordable far into the future without bankrupting those accounts.
 They may show profit on the balance sheets of our generation, but our children will inherit the losses.
 We borrow environmental capital from future generations with no intention or prospect of repaying.
 They may blame us for our wasteful ways, but they can never collect on our debt to them.
 We act as we do because we can get away with it future generations do not vote they have no political or financial power they cannot challenge our decisions.

The precision of the lines on the map, the consistency with which symbols are used, the grid andor projection system, the apparent certainty with which place names are written and placed, and the legend and scale information all give the map an aura of scientific accuracy and objectivity.
 Although subjective interpretation goes into the construction of these cartographic elements, the finished map appears to express an authoritative truth about the world, separate from any interests and influences.
 The very trust that this apparent objectivity inspires is what makes maps such powerful carriers of ideology.
 However unnoticeably, maps do indeed reflect the world views of either their makers or, more probably, the supporters of their makers, in addition to the political and social conditions under which they were made.

 As a system for transmitting specific factual information without any distortion or ambiguity, the sign system of honeybees would probably win easily over human language every time.
 However, language offers something more valuable than mere information exchange.
 Because the meanings of words are not invariable and because understanding always involves interpretation, the act of communicating is always a joint, creative effort.
 Words can carry meanings beyond those consciously intended by speakers or writers because listeners or readers bring their own perspectives to the language they encounter.
 Ideas expressed imprecisely may be more intellectually stimulating for listeners or readers than simple facts.
 The fact that language is not always reliable for causing precise meanings to be generated in someone elses mind is a reflection of its powerful strength as a medium for creating new understanding.
 It is the inherent ambiguity and adaptability of language as a meaningmaking system that makes the relationship between language and thinking so special.

 This material from which his final work is composed consists not of living men or real landscapes, not of real, actual stagesets, but only of their images, recorded on separate strips that can be shortened, altered, and assembled according to his will.
 The elements of reality are fixed on these pieces by combining them in his selected sequence, shortening and lengthening them according to his desire, the director builds up his own filmic time and filmic space.
 He does not adapt reality, but uses it for the creation of a new reality, and the most characteristic and important aspect of this process is that, in it, laws of space and time invariable and inescapable in work with actuality become obedient.

 When people face real adversity disease, unemployment, or the disabilities of age affection from a pet takes on new meaning.
 A pets continuing affection becomes crucially important for those enduring hardship because it reassures them that their core essence has not been damaged.
 Thus pets are important in the treatment of depressed or chronically ill patients.
 In addition, pets are used  to great advantage with the institutionalized aged.
 In such institutions it is difficult for the staff to retain optimism when all the patients are declining in health.
 Children who visit cannot help but remember what their parents or grandparents once were and be depressed by their incapacities.
 Animals, however, have no expectations about mental capacity.
 They do not worship youth.
 They have no memories about what the aged once was and greet them as if they were children.
 An old man holding a puppy can relive a childhood moment with complete accuracy.

 With Bob acting as interpreter, Paul offered  and his opponent proposed .
 The bargaining in the noisy market became spirited, even intense, with Paul stepping up his price slightly and the seller going down slowly.
 The pace increased so fast that Bob could not keep up with the backandforth interpretation.
 Meanwhile, observing the seller carefully, Paul sensed something wrong in Bobs interpretation.
 In fact, the seller had gone below Pauls last offer.
 When Paul raised his doubt, Bob instantly recognized the error and corrected his interpretation.
 At length, they settled the deal, and he was delighted to purchase the carving at a reasonable price and thanked Bob.

 The creativity that children possess needs to be cultivated throughout their development.
 Research suggests that overstructuring the childs environment may actually limit creative and academic development.
 This is a central problem with much of science instruction.
 The exercises or activities are devised to eliminate different options and to focus on predetermined results.
 The answers are structured to fit the course assessments, and the wonder of science is lost along with cognitive intrigue.
 We define cognitive intrigue as the wonder that stimulates and intrinsically motivates an individual to voluntarily engage in an activity.
 The loss of cognitive intrigue may be initiated by the sole use of play items with predetermined conclusions and reinforced by rote instruction in school.
 This is exemplified by toys, games, and lessons that are an  in and of themselves and require little of the individual other than to master the planned objective.

 Satellites are collecting a great deal of imagery as you read this sentence.
 However, most applications in geography and environmental studies do not require extremely finegrained temporal resolution.
 Meteorologists may require visible, infrared, and radar information at subhourly temporal resolution urban planners might require imagery at monthly or annual resolution and transportation planners may not need any time series information at all for some applications.

Most often, you will find or meet people who introduce themselves in terms of their work or by what they spend time on.
 These people introduce themselves as a salesman or an executive.
 There is nothing criminal in doing this, but psychologically, we become what we believe.
 Identifying what we can do in the workplace serves to enhance the quality of our professional career.
 People who follow this practice tend to lose their individuality and begin to live with the notion that they are recognized by the job they do.
 However, jobs may not be permanent, and you may lose your job for countless reasons, some of which you may not even be responsible for.
 In such a case, these people suffer from an inevitable social and mental trauma, leading to emotional stress and a feeling that all of a sudden they have been disassociated from what once was their identity.

Interestingly, being observed has two quite distinct effects on performance.
 In some cases, performance is decreased, even to the point of nonexistence.
 The extreme of this is stage fright, the sudden fear of public performance.
A So, if you are learning to play a new sport, it is better to begin it alone, but when you become skilled at it, then you will probably perform better with an audience.
B There are many instances of wellknown actors who, in midcareer, develop stage fright and simply cannot perform.
 The other extreme is that being observed enhances performance, people doing whatever it might be better when they know that others are watching.
C The general rule seems to be that if one is doing something new or for the first time, then being observed while doing it decreases performance.
 On the other hand, being observed while doing some task or engaging in some activity that is well known or well practiced tends to enhance performance.

Evolution works to maximize the number of descendants that an animal leaves behind.
 Where the risk of death from fishing increases as an animal grows, evolution favors those that grow slowly, mature younger and smaller, and reproduce earlier.
A Surely these adaptations are good news for species hardpressed by excessive fishing.
 Not exactly.
 Young fish produce many fewer eggs than largebodied animals, and many industrial fisheries are now so intensive that few animals survive more than a couple of years beyond the age of maturity.
B This is exactly what we now see in the wild.

What is the best order for a report, paper or other technical document.
 Of course, it must be logical but that means simply that the paper must have connection and sequence, and a variety of orders is possible under this heading.
 Too many writers interpret the term logical to mean chronological, and it has become habitual to begin reports and papers with careful reviews of previous work.
   Usually, this is tactically weak.
   Therefore, to rehearse to them the findings of previous work is simply to bore them with unnecessary reminders.

 Residents commonly have positive views on the economic and some sociocultural influences of tourism on quality of life, but their reactions to environmental impacts are mixed.
 Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas, improves the quality of the roads and public facilities, and does not contribute to ecological decline.
 Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems, overcrowded outdoor recreation, or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks.
 Alternatively, some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing, hunting, and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion.

Duration refers to the time that events last.
 If we think of tempo as the speed of events, then duration is the speed of the clock itself.
 For the physicist, the duration of a second is precise and unambiguous it is equal to ,,, cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium.
 In the realm of psychological experience, however, quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation.
 When people are removed from the cues of real time be it the sun, bodily fatigue, or timepieces themselves it doesnt take long before their time sense breaks down.
 And it is this usually A psychological clock, as opposed to the time on ones watch, that creates the perception of duration that people experience.
 Theoretically, a person who mentally stretches the duration of time should experience a slower tempo.
 Imagine, for example, that baseballs are pitched to two different batters.
 The balls are thrown every  seconds for  seconds, so a total of  balls are thrown.
 We now ask both batters how much time has passed.
 Lets say that batter number one who loves hitting feels the duration to be  seconds.
 Batter number two bored by baseball believes it to be  seconds.
 Psychologically, then, the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds.
