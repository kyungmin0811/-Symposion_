The start of the boat tour was far from what I had expected.
None of the wildlife I saw was exotic.
I could only see dull gray rocks.
It was also so hot and humid that I could not enjoy the tour fully.
However, as the boat slid into the Bay Park Canal, all of a sudden my mother shouted, “Look at the mangroves” A whole new world came into sight.
The mangrove forest alongside the canal thrilled me as we entered its cool shade.
I was fascinated by the beautiful leaves and flowers of the mangroves.
But best of all, I was charmed by the native birds, monkeys, and lizards moving among the branches.
“What a wonderful adventure” I exclaimed.

At the  Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, Ginni Rometty offered this advice “When did you ever learn the most in your life What experience I guarantee you’ll tell me it was a time you felt at risk.” To become a better leader, you have to step out of your comfort zone.
You have to challenge the conventional ways of doing things and search for opportunities to innovate.
Exercising leadership not only requires you to challenge the organizational status quo but also requires you to challenge your internal status quo.
You have to challenge yourself.
You have to venture beyond the boundaries of your current experience and explore new territory.
Those are the places where there are opportunities to improve, innovate, experiment, and grow.
Growth is always at the edges, just outside the boundaries of where you are right now.

One exercise in teamwork I do at a company retreat is to put the group in a circle.
At one particular retreat, there were eight people in the circle, and I slowly handed tennis balls to one person to start throwing around the circle.
If N equals the number of people in the circle, then the maximum number of balls you can have in motion is N minus .
Why Because it’s almost impossible to throw and catch at the same time.
The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the importance of an individual’s action.
People are much more concerned about catching the ball than throwing it.
What this demonstrates is that it’s equally important to the success of the exercise that the person you’re throwing to catches the ball as that you are able to catch the ball.
If you’re less concerned about how you deliver information than with how you receive it, you’ll ultimately fail at delegation.
You have to be equally skilled at both.

Sensoryspecific satiety is defined as a decrease in appetite, or the subjective liking for the food that is consumed, with little change in the hedonics of uneaten food.
As a result of sensoryspecific satiety, when people consume a variety of foods, they tend to overeat.
A greater variety of food leads people to eat more than they would otherwise.
So, being full and feeling sated are separate matters.
The recovery of appetite or the motivation to eat is apparent to anyone who has consumed a large meal and is quite full, and does not require additional energy or nutrients to meet their daily needs, but decides to consume additional calories after seeing the dessert cart.
Small changes in the sensory properties of foods are sufficient to increase food intake.
For example, subjects who were presented with different shapes of pasta showed increased hedonic ratings and increased energy consumption relative to subjects eating only a single shape of pasta.

Individual authors and photographers have rights to their intellectual property during their lifetimes, and their heirs have rights for  years after the creator’s death, so any publication less than  years old has to be checked for its copyright status.
The duration of copyright protection has increased steadily over the years; the lifeplusyears standard was set by the Copyright Term Extension Act of , which increased the year limit established by the  Copyright Act.
Supporters of such legislation like to defend these increases with tales of starving writers and their impoverished descendants, but in reality the beneficiaries are more likely to be transnational publishing companies.
And note that copyright laws serve a dual purpose.
In addition to protecting the rights of authors so as to encourage the publication of new creative works, copyright is also supposed to place reasonable time limits on those rights so that outdated works may be incorporated into new creative efforts.
Therefore, the extended copyright protection frustrates new creative endeavors such as including poetry and song lyrics on Internet sites.

Psychologists who study giving behavior have noticed that some people give substantial amounts to one or two charities, while others give small amounts to many charities.
Those who donate to one or two charities seek evidence about what the charity is doing and what it is really having a positive impact.
If the evidence indicates that the charity is really helping others, they make a substantial donation.
Those who give small amounts to many charities are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others psychologists call them warm glow givers.
Knowing that they are giving makes them feel good, regardless of the impact of their donation.
In many cases the donation is so small  or less that if they stopped to think, they would realize that the cost of processing the donation is likely to exceed any benefit it brings to the charity.

Some prominent journalists say that archaeologists should work with treasure hunters because treasure hunters have accumulated valuable historical artifacts that can reveal much about the past.
But archaeologists are not asked to cooperate with tomb robbers, who also have valuable historical artifacts.
The quest for profit and the search for knowledge cannot coexist in archaeology because of the time factor.
Rather incredibly, one archaeologist employed by a treasure hunting firm said that as long as archaeologists are given six months to study shipwrecked artifacts before they are sold, no historical knowledge is found On the contrary, archaeologists and assistants from the INA (Institute of Nautical Archaeology) needed more than a decade of yearround conservation before they could even catalog all the finds from an eleventhcentury AD wreck they had excavated.
Then, to interpret those finds, they had to learn Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian, without which they would never have learned the true nature of the site.
Could a “commercial archaeologist” have waited more than a decade or so before selling the finds prominent    excavate

Apocalypse Now, a film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, gained widespread popularity, and for good reason.
The film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novel Heart of Darkness, which is set in the African Congo at the end of the th century.
Unlike the original novel, Apocalypse Now is set in Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War.
The setting, time period, dialogue and other incidental details are changed but the fundamental narrative and themes of Apocalypse Now are the same as those of Heart of Darkness.
Both describe a physical journey, reflecting the central character’s mental and spiritual journey, down a river to confront the deranged Kurtz character, who represents the worst aspects of civilisation.
By giving Apocalypse Now a setting that was contemporary at the time of its release, audiences were able to experience and identify with its themes more easily than they would have if the film had been                                                                                           .

In the context of SNS, media literacy has been argued to be especially important “in order to make the users aware of their rights when using SNS tools, and also help them acquire or reinforce human rights values and develop the behaviour necessary to respect other people’s rights and freedoms”.
With regard to peertopeer risks such as bullying, this last element is of particular importance.
This relates to a basic principle that children are taught in the offline world as well ‘do not do to others what you would not want others to do to you’.
Children’s SNS activities should be encouraged when we help them accumulate knowledge.
This should also be a golden rule with regard to SNS, but for children and young people it is much more difficult to estimate the consequences and potential serious impact of their actions in this environment.
Hence, raising awareness of children from a very early age about the particular characteristics of SNS and the potential longterm impact of a seemingly trivial act is crucial.

.Most consumer magazines depend on subscriptions and advertising.
Subscriptions account for almost  percent of total magazine circulation.
Singlecopy, or newsstand, sales account for the rest.(A) For example, the Columbia Journalism Review is marketed toward professional journalists and its few advertisements are news organizations, book publishers, and others.
A few magazines, like Consumer Reports, work toward objectivity and therefore contain no advertising.(B) However, singlecopy sales are important they bring in more revenue per magazine, because subscription prices are typically at least  percent less than the price of buying single issues.(C) Further, potential readers explore a new magazine by buying a single issue; all those insert cards with subscription offers are included in magazines to encourage you to subscribe.
Some magazines are distributed only by subscription.
Professional or trade magazines are specialized magazines and are often published by professional associations.
They usually feature highly targeted advertising.

.Experiments show that rats display an immediate liking for salt the first time they experience a salt deficiency.
Both humans and rats have evolved taste preferences for sweet foods, which provide rich sources of calories.
A study of food preferences among the Hadza huntergatherers of Tanzania found that honey was the most highly preferred food item, an item that has the highest caloric value.
( ) Human newborn infants also show a strong preference for sweet liquids.
( ) Both humans and rats dislike bitter and sour foods, which tend to contain toxins.
( ) They also adaptively adjust their eating behavior in response to deficits in water, calories, and salt.
( ) They likewise increase their intake of sweets and water when their energy and fluids become depleted.
( ) These appear to be specific evolved mechanisms, designed to deal with the adaptive problem of food selection, and coordinate consumption patterns with physical needs.

Factories were discharging mercury into the waters of Minamata Bay, which also harbored a commercial fishing industry.
Mercury was being bioaccumulated in the fish tissue and severe mercury poisoning occurred in many people who consumed the fish.
( ) The disabling neurological symptoms were subsequently called Minamata disease.
( ) Control over direct discharge of mercury from industrial operations is clearly needed for prevention.
( ) However, it is now recognized that traces of mercury can appear in lakes far removed from any such industrial discharge.
( ) Strictly controlled emission standards for such sources are needed to minimize this problem.
( ) Fish advisories have been issued for many lakes in the United States; these recommend limits on the number of times per month particular species of fish should be consumed.

Time spent on online interaction with members of one’s own, preselected community leaves less time available for actual encounters with a wide variety of people.
If physicists, for example, were to concentrate on exchanging email and electronic preprints with other physicists around the world working in the same specialized subject area, they would likely devote less time, and be less receptive to new ways of looking at the world.
Facilitating the voluntary construction of highly homogeneous social networks of scientific communication therefore allows individuals to filter the potentially overwhelming flow of information.
But the result may be the tendency to overfilter it, thus eliminating the diversity of the knowledge circulating and diminishing the frequency of radically new ideas.
In this regard, even a journey through the stacks of a real library can be more fruitful than a trip through today’s distributed virtual archives, because it seems difficult to use the available “search engines” to emulate efficiently the mixture of predictable and surprising discoveries that typically result from a physical shelfsearch of an extensive library collection.

In one sense, every character you create will be yourself.
You’ve never murdered, but your murderer’s rage will be drawn from memories of your own extreme anger.
Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments.
That scene in which your octogenarian feels humiliated will draw on your experience of humiliation in the eighth grade, even though the circumstances are totally different and you’re not even consciously thinking about your middleschool years.
Our characters’ emotions, after all, draw on our own emotions.
Sometimes, however, you will want to use your life more directly in your fiction, dramatizing actual incidents.
Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield.
Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself The problem with this and it is a very large problem is that almost no one can view himself                   on the page.
As the writer, you’re too close to your own complicated makeup.
It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you.
In fact, that’s what authors largely have done.
You can still, of course, incorporate aspects of yourself your love of Beethoven, your quick temper, your soccer injuries.
But by applying your own experience to a different protagonist, you can take advantage of your insider knowledge of the situation, and yet gain an objectivity and control that the original intense situation, by definition, did not have.

(A)It was the first day of the new semester.
Steve and Dave were excited that they would be back at school again.
They rode their bicycles to school together that morning, as they usually did.
Dave had math on the first floor, and Steve was on the second with history.
On his way to the classroom, Steve’s teacher came up to him to ask if (a) he wanted to run for student president.
Steve thought for a moment and answered, “Sure, it’ll be a great experience.”(B)Steve won the election.
Upon hearing the result, Dave went over to Steve and congratulated (b) him, shaking his hand.
Steve could still see the disappointment burning in his eyes.
It wasn’t until later that evening, on the way home, that Dave said apologetically, “I’m so sorry, Steve This election hasn’t damaged our friendship, has it” “Of course not, Dave.
We’re friends as always” Steve responded with a smile.
As Steve arrived home, his dad was proudly waiting for him and said, “Congratulations on the win How did Dave take it” Steve replied, “We’re fine now, best friends for life” (c) His dad laughed, “Sounds like you won two battles today”(C)After class, Steve spotted Dave in the hallway and ran to him excitedly, “I’ve got good news I’m going for student president and I think mine will be the only nomination.” Dave cleared his throat and replied with surprise, “Actually, I’ve just registered my name, too” (d) He continued sharply, “Well, best of luck But don’t think you’ll win the election, Steve.” Dave walked quickly away and from that moment on, there was an uncomfortable air of tension between the two friends.
Steve tried to be friendly toward Dave, but he just didn’t seem to care.(D)When the election day came, Steve found that his bicycle had a flat tire, so he started to run to school.
Just as he reached the end of the street, Dave’s dad, who was driving Dave to school, pulled over to give him a ride.
The dead silence in the car made the drive painful.
Noticing the bad atmosphere, Dave’s dad said, “You know, only one of you can win.
You have known each other since birth.
Don’t let this election ruin your friendship.
Try to be happy for each other” His words hit Dave hard.
Looking at Steve, Dave felt the need to apologize to (e) him later that day.
