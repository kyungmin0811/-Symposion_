Dear Ms.
Molly Oliver,This is Mark Foster, one of the volunteers for the Auditory Frog and Toad Survey.
Unfortunately, I was not able to participate in the orientation last weekend, so I could not receive training in distinguishing the sounds of frogs and toads.
I heard from another participant that a CD was used in the training session.
I was wondering if you could send me one.
Since we have ten more days before the survey begins, I’ll have enough time to receive and use the CD to train myself.
You can send it to me at the address in my application.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Thank you.Sincerely,Mark Foster

When she heard the dogs barking fiercely on the floor just above her, she trembled uncontrollably for fear of being caught.
Drops of cold sweat rolled down her back.
Before slipping into the hold of the boat, she had scattered powder, which Swedish scientists had developed, unnoticeably on the floor above in order to distract the dogs.
But she knew that these dogs were so well trained that they could smell her, even though a load of fish had been dumped over her hiding place.
She held her hands together tightly and tried not to make any noise.
She was not sure how long she could stay like that.
To her relief, it wasn’t long before a whistle called the dogs out, leaving her unfound.
She relaxed her hands and exhaled a deep breath.
She felt safe now.

Have you ever met someone while you were experiencing significant emotional, psychological, or physical stress Perhaps you stayed up all night studying for a final, or maybe you learned that a grandparent recently died.
You likely exhibited behaviors that are not consistent with how you usually act.
Meeting someone when you are extremely stressed can create an inaccurate impression of you.
For this reason, recognize that our first impressions of others also may be perceptual errors.
To help avoid committing these errors, engage in perception checking, which means that we consider a series of questions to confirm or challenge our perceptions of others and their behaviors.
For example, see if you can provide two possible interpretations for the verbal and nonverbal behavior observed and seek clarification of it in order to determine the accuracy of your evaluation.

When we see a happy face (or an angry one), it subtly generates the corresponding emotion in us.
To the degree we take on the pace, posture, and facial expression of another person, we start to inhabit their emotional space; as our body mimics the other’s, we begin to experience emotional matching.
Our nervous system is automatically set to engage in this emotional empathy.
But how well we use this capacity is largely a learned ability.
Animalsand peoplewho have been raised in extreme social isolation are poor at reading emotional cues in those around them not because they lack the basic circuitry for empathy but because, lacking emotional tutors, they have never learned to pay attention to these messages and so haven’t practiced this skill.

When we hear a story, we look for beliefs that are being commented upon.
Any story has many possible beliefs inherent in it.
But how does someone listening to a story find those beliefs We find them by looking through the beliefs we already have.
We are not as concerned with what we are hearing as we are with finding what we already know that is relevant.
Picture it in this way.
As understanders, we have a list of beliefs, indexed by subject area.
When a new story appears, we attempt to find a belief of ours that relates to it.
When we do, we find a story attached to that belief and compare the story in our memory to the one we are processing.
Our understanding of the new story becomes, at that point, a function of the old story.
Once we find a belief and connected story, we need no further processing; that is, the search for other beliefs stops.

Savannas pose a bit of a problem for ecologists.
There is an axiom in ecology that ‘complete competitors cannot coexist’ in other words, where two populations of organisms use exactly the same resources, one would be expected to do so slightly more efficiently than the other and therefore come to dominate in the long term.
In temperate parts of the world, either trees dominate (in forests) or grasses dominate (in grasslands).
Yet, in savannas grasses and trees coexist.
The classic explanation proposes that trees have deep roots while grasses have shallow roots.
The two plant types are therefore able to coexist because they are not in fact competitors the trees increase in wetter climates and on sandier soils because more water is able to penetrate to the deep roots.
Trees do indeed have a few small roots which penetrate to great depth, but most of their roots are in the top halfmetre of the soil, just where the grass roots are.

Sequoyah, a Cherokee Indian, was born in about  in Taskigi, now in Tennessee.
Raised by his Cherokee mother, the young Sequoyah never learned to read or write English.
While interacting with English speakers, he realized the necessity of a writing system for the Cherokee people.
In about , Sequoyah began developing a system of writing, adapting letters from English, Greek, and Hebrew.
By , he had created a system of  symbols, representing all the syllables of the Cherokee language.
The Cherokee people began to use the system in their schools and publish books and newspapers in their language.
In , the General Council of the Eastern Cherokees awarded Sequoyah a medal in honor of his accomplishment.
Sequoyah moved to Oklahoma some years later and died in what is now Texas in .
And later, people remembered him by naming a certain tree species “Sequoia.” syllable

If an animal is innately programmed for some type of behaviour, then there are likely to be biological clues.
It is no accident that fish have bodies which are streamlined and smooth, with fins and a powerful tail.
Their bodies are structurally adapted for moving fast through the water.
Similarly, if you found a dead bird or mosquito, you could guess by looking at its wings that flying was its normal mode of transport.
However, we must not be overoptimistic.
Biological clues are not essential.
The extent to which they are finding varies from animal to animal and from activity to activity.
For example, it is impossible to guess from their bodies that birds make nests, and, sometimes, animals behave in a way quite contrary to what might be expected from their physical form ghost spiders have tremendously long legs, yet they weave webs out of very short threads.
To a human observer, their legs seem a great hindrance as they spin and move about the web.Kingston Badminton ProgramAre you looking for a simple and effective sports program Then check out the Kingston Badminton Program and choose one of our courses taught by the most experienced badminton coaches.Course sessions will be held three days a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) for  weeks from June  to July .

In , researchers at Wayne State University asked a group of college volunteers to exercise for twenty minutes at a (A) preset  selfselected  pace on each of three machines a treadmill, a stationary bike, and a stair climber.
Measurements of heart rate, oxygen consumption, and perceived effort were taken throughout all three workouts.
The researchers expected to find that the subjects unconsciously targeted the same relative physiological intensity in each activity.
Perhaps they would (B) automatically  intentionally  exercise at  percent of their maximum heart rate regardless of which machine they were using.
Or maybe they would instinctively settle into rhythm at  percent of their maximum rate of oxygen consumption in all three workouts.
But that’s not what happened.
There was, in fact, no (C) consistency  variation  in measurements of heart rate and oxygen consumption across the three disciplines.
Instead, the subjects were found to have chosen the same level of perceived effort on the treadmill, the bike, and the stair climber.

Once a hand or gripper has been directed to an object by reaching, it can be grasped.
Grasping requires that fingers hold an object securely.
A secure grip is one in which the object won’t slip or move, especially when displaced by an external force.
Your grasp on a hammer, for example, would not be secure if knocking against something caused you to drop it.
One precondition of a firm grasp is that the forces applied by the fingers balance each other so as not to disturb the object’s position.
The characteristics of an object such as its geometric configuration and mass distribution may demand that some fingers apply greater force than others to maintain .
The grasp and support forces must also match overall object mass and fragility.
An egg requires a more delicate touch than a rock.

Roles are like a fence.
They allow us a certain amount of freedom, but for most of us that freedom doesn’t go very far.
Suppose that a woman decides that she is not going to wear dressesor a man that he will not wear suits and tiesregardless of what anyone says.
In most situations, they’ll stick to their decision.
When a formal occasion comes along, however, such as a family wedding or a funeral, they are likely to cave in to norms that they find overwhelming.
The increasing social pressure discourages us from fulfilling the social norms and committing ourselves to shared social conventions of behaviour.
Almost all of us follow the guidelines for what is “appropriate” for our roles.
Few of us are bothered by such restrictions, for our socialization is so thorough that we usually want to do what our roles indicate is appropriate.

.The ancient Greeks sought to improve memory through brain training methods such as memory palaces and the method of loci.
At the same time, they and the Egyptians became experts at externalizing information, inventing the modern library, a grand storehouse for externalized knowledge.(A) This need isn’t simply learned; it is a biological imperativeanimals organize their environments instinctively.
Most mammals are biologically programmed to put their digestive waste away from where they eat and sleep.(B) We don’t know why these simultaneous explosions of intellectual activity occurred when they did (perhaps daily human experience had hit a certain level of complexity).
But the human need to organize our lives, our environment, even our thoughts, remains strong.(C) Dogs have been known to collect their toys and put them in baskets; ants carry off dead members of the colony to burial grounds; certain birds and rodents create barriers around their nests in order to more easily detect invaders.

.That is why people experience jet lag when traveling across time zones.In humans, body clocks are responsible for daily changes in blood pressure, body temperature, hormones, hunger, and thirst, as well as our sleepwake cycles.
( ) These biological rhythms, which we experience as internal time, are probably older than sleep, developed over the course of millions of years of evolution.
( ) They facilitate physiological and behavioral changes on a roughly twentyfourhour cycle no matter what is happening outside, whether a cold front moves in or clouds block the light of the sun.
( ) Their internal clocks continue to run in accordance with the place they left behind, not the one to which they have come, and it can take some time to realign the two.
( ) The most remarkable thing is that our internal body clocks can be readjusted by environmental cues.
( ) We may get jet lag for a few days when we ask our body clocks to adapt to a vastly different schedule of day and night cycles on the other side of the Earth, but they can do it.

This generated a great deal of resistance.
( ) To the service representatives, learning to sell was a very different game from what they had been playing.

Lawyers and scientists use argument to mean a summary of evidence and principles leading to a conclusion; however, a scientific argument is different from a legal argument.
A prosecuting attorney constructs an argument to persuade the judge or a jury that the accused is guilty; a defense attorney in the same trial constructs an argument to persuade the same judge or jury toward the opposite conclusion.
Neither prosecutor nor defender is obliged to consider anything that weakens their respective cases.
On the contrary, scientists construct arguments because they want to test their own ideas and give an accurate explanation of some aspect of nature.
Scientists can include any evidence or hypothesis that supports their claim, but they must observe one fundamental rule of professional science.
They must include all of the known evidence and all of the hypotheses previously proposed.
Unlike lawyers, scientists must explicitly account for the possibility that they might be wrong.Unlike lawyers, who utilize information (A) to support their arguments, scientists must include all information even if some of it is unlikely to (B) their arguments.(A)(B)

The idea of protecting intellectual activity and creation has deep roots.
The ancient Greeks used an awards system to (A) design achievements, which performed some of the same functions as the modern patent system.
Their pottery, sculptures, and other manufactured goods had symbols on them to note the tradesmen who created them, which are the predecessors of modern trademarks.
Similar marks and symbols functioning as trademarks have been found on Chinese pottery, possibly dating as far back as  BCE, and in many other ancient societies, including the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Vedic civilization.The concept of intellectual property continued to develop during the Roman period.
The Roman Empire had an incredible variety of trademarks.
Roman potters alone used approximately , trademarks.
Additionally, Roman authors had a sense that their intellectual creations were (B), as they complained about the exploitation of those creations.
Their sense of injustice was probably heightened by the fact that there were laws and traditions in place that supported their belief that only they could exploit their creations.
Roman authors could, in fact, make money from the copying and publishing of their works because the value of their intellectual creations was recognized.

Skirts were bouncing lightly and pants were dancing delightedly in the seasonable weather as the spring breeze chased them playfully.
Some seemed excited, walking like racing cars between passersby.
He had ordered two black coffees, one for himself and one for his friend, Julie.
She was running late, but the service was fast.
The hot coffees were promptly placed in front of (a) him.(B)Handing a spray can of cream over to Richard, the waiter said, “Add it now if you want.” Richard couldn’t help asking him why.
(b) The blueshirted man answered, “Actually, hotter coffee loses energy faster than coffee cooled slightly by the addition of cream.” “Really Is that so” The waiter kindly smiled and said, “Yeah, I just learned it when I took a class about coffee.” He also taught (c) his customer how to make shapes with the cream.
Richard paid close attention to his explanation.(C)Looking at the coffees, Richard remembered that Julie liked whipped cream on top of her hot coffee.
He was wondering if it was better to put the cream on now, or wait till she arrived.
“Since the cream is cold, it’ll cool down the coffee faster,” he reasoned.
Beep It was a text message from her.
“I’ll be there in  minutes.
Please put some cream on my coffee.” He was startled, because she seemed to know what he was thinking about.
(d) Richard called over a waiter wearing a blue shirt and asked him for whipped cream.(D)Richard thanked the waiter.
Following his instructions, Richard made a flower with the cream.
He tried to be as precise as he could.
No sooner had he completed his masterpiece, Julie stepped into the cafe.
As she sat down, she saw her coffee.
“Wow, look at that A white flower in the cup It looks so beautiful, Richard It’s too lovely to drink,” his friend said.
“Try it,” (e) the happy man urged her.
She tasted it.
“This coffee is absolutely delicious, too” Talking and laughing over coffee, they enjoyed the fabulous spring day.
