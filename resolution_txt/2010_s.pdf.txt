This, in the simplest definition, is a promise enforceable by law.
The promise may be to do something or to stop from doing something.
The making of this requires the mutual agreement of two or more persons or parties, one of them ordinarily making an offer and another accepting.
If one of the parties fails to keep the promise, the other has rights to compensation.
The law about this considers such questions as whether this exists, what the meaning of this is, whether this has been broken, and what compensation is due to the injured party.

Upon receiving your last letter, I rushed to look up the word ‘flattering’ in the dictionary.
I was shocked to find out that it could imply something negative, which I certainly did not mean.
I should have used some word like ‘complimentary’ instead.
For that, I would like to ask for the kindness in your heart to forgive my unintended offense.
If you knew me well, you would know that I am shameless enough to take all compliments at their face value and not to think that they might be mere flattery.
I just did not know what the word really implied.
I hope that you no longer feel hurt or uncomfortable in any way as a result of our correspondence.

While manned space missions are more costly than unmanned ones, they are more successful.
Robots and astronauts use much of the same equipment in space.
But a human is much more capable of operating those instruments correctly and to place them in appropriate and useful positions.
Rarely is a computer more sensitive and accurate than a human in managing the same geographical or environmental factors.
Robots are also not equipped with capabilities like humans to solve problems as they arise, and they often collect data that are unhelpful or irrelevant.

Most of you experience urges when trying to break a habit and these can be hard to resist unless you find something else to do instead, and best of all, something that uses the same part of the body ― even the same muscles.
If the habit involves your hands, as when pulling out hair, then try to occupy them in some other way.
Playing with a toy or opening and closing your fists for a couple of minutes might be an answer.
The habit of scratching can be replaced with rubbing in some lotion or patting with the palm of the hand.
If the itches, however, do not disappear, stop scratching and take the medicine.
One yearold woman who used to rub her eyes with her hands until they became sore and infected found it helpful to put on makeup when she was tempted to rub.

In this modern world, people are not used to living with discomfort.
We expect immediate results and satisfaction.
We want answers faster than they can be delivered.
There is twentyfourhour repair and roundtheclock shopping.
If we are hungry, there is always food available, from microwave dinners to allnight grocery stores and restaurants.
People no longer know how to wait, or even what waiting means.
It is nice to have what you want when you want it, but the ability to delay satisfaction is important.

He sat for a time in front of the fireplace, crosslegged, adding logs, and gazing at the warm fire.

Your party and the other party are sitting across a table.
You ask a question on a particular subject and the answer is unsatisfactory.
What would be the best response It is none at all.
So if you are seeking more information or a different kind of information, ask for it by remaining silent.
When there is a long pause in the conversation, people feel an overwhelming need to fill it.
If someone has finished speaking and you do not play along by taking up your end of the dialog, that person will automatically start to elaborate.
Eventually, they may say what you want to hear.

Whereas the largemouth likes slow or still water with lots of foodholding weeds, the smallmouth prefers clean, rocky bottoms and swifter water, ideally in the range of  to F.
In waters warmer than F, you can forget about finding one.
In lakes, smallmouth often school up, which means that if you catch one, you can catch a bunch.
In rivers and streams, they are more solitary.
The smallmouth has a series of dark vertical bands along its sides.
The dorsal fin is one continuous fin (as opposed to the separated dorsal fin of the largemouth).

Starting in the s, people began flooding into Chattanooga, a former factory town, to explore its caves, rivers, and cliffs.
Before long more than , caves surrounding the city had been discovered.
The nearby Ocoee was among the most paddled rivers in the country and six major climbing sites sprang up within an hour’s drive of city limits.
But in spite of this boundless outdoors potential, there remained the problem of Chattanooga proper, a postindustrial wasteland that made the city the kind of place you would visit but would never want to live in.
Not, that is, until lately.
Over the past decade, Chattanooga has made an incredible urban comeback electric buses, organic markets, and a milliondollar riverfront restoration project completed last year.
In addition, beautiful modern architecture such as the postmodern museum and the newly remodeled aquarium plays a big role in the comeback of Chattanooga.

In practical situations where there is no room for error, we have learned to avoid vagueness in communication.
A fire chief, for example, needs to issue his orders with absolute clarity.
In imaginative situations, however, there is the danger that too much specificity can limit your imagination.
Let’s suppose that the same fire chief has asked you to paint a picture on the side of his firehouse.
If he tells you what he wants it to look like right down to the last detail, he has not given you any room for your imagination.
However, if the assignment were stated somewhat vaguely, then you would have more room to think and be more creative.

However, now that the economy is characterized more by the exchange of information than by hard goods, geographical centrality has been replaced by attempts to create a sense of cultural centrality.
Now, as always, cities are desperate to create the impression that they lie at the center of something or other.
( ) This idea of centrality may be locational, namely that a city lies at the geographical center of England, Europe, and so on.
( ) This draws on a wellestablished notion that geographical centrality makes a place more accessible, easing communication and communication costs.
( ) Cultural centrality usually demonstrates itself as a cry that a city is at the center of the action.
( ) This means that the city has an abundance of cultural activities, such as restaurants, theater, ballet, music, sport, and scenery.
( ) The suggestion is that people will want for nothing in this city.

Young children rarely think of their art as personal property.
Often they throw it away or give it away.
This suggests that much of the value of art for a child consists in making it.
Interestingly, art in tribal societies is frequently abandoned after it has served its purpose.
The focus is on the magical, expressive, and social value of the act of making.
Some contemporary artists share this feeling, but they are also caught up in the system of art exhibition, the selling of their art, and the requirements of an art market.
This results in a tension in the art world that is largely unresolved ― the tension between art as a satisfying mode of expression and art as a precious collectible object, between the experience of making and the experience of owning.

How can you create closeness when the two of you are hundreds of miles apart How can you make the person you are talking to on the phone feel special when you cannot pat their back or give them a little hug The answer is simple.
Just use your caller’s name far more often than you would in person.
In fact, shower your conversations with his or her name.
Saying a person’s name too often in facetoface conversation sounds manipulative.
However, on the phone the effect is dramatically different.
If you heard someone say your name, even if you were being pushed around in a big noisy crowd, you would pay attention and listen.

Many years ago, psychologists performed an experiment in which they put a number of people in a room, alone except for a ring toss set.
It was one of those children’s toys with a short wooden post held upright on the floor and a bunch of round rings.
The subjects were left alone to amuse themselves as best they could.
As expected, with time to kill, they began trying to toss the rings around the post.
What the psychologists discovered was that most of the people moved far enough away from the post so that tossing the rings around it was challenging but not so difficult as to be totally frustrating.
In other words, they deliberately positioned themselves between frustration on the one hand and boredom on the other.
The process of alternately producing and relieving tension was what made the activity stimulating.Subjects tended to make a ring toss activity stimulating by producing just enough    (A)    through varying the distance to the post so as to    (B)    frustration and boredom.

I was a child who desperately wanted to connect with others.
We did live ‘by the side of the road’ ― on Route  between Keene and Portsmouth ― but in a place so remote it was extremely difficult to be a ‘friend to man.’(B)Why couldn’t others also benefit from that value I could save people the trouble of going into the store by making my produce accessible at the side of the road, and that would provide value, too.
Surely I could convince people to pay half of what the grocery store charged and to feel lucky about the bargain.

They were fresh and clean and came straight from the good earth.
