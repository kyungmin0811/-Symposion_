Researchers studied two mobile phone companies trying to solve a technological problem.
One company developed what it called a ‘technology shelf,’ created by a small group of engineers, on which was placed possible technical solutions that other teams might use in the future.
It also created an openended conversation among its engineers in which salespeople and designers were often included.
The boundaries among business units were deliberately ambiguous because more than technical information was needed to get a feeling for the problem.
However, the other company proceeded with more seeming clarity and discipline, dividing the problem into its parts.
Different departments protected their territory.
Individuals and teams, competing with each other, stopped sharing information.
The two companies did eventually solve the technological problem, but the latter company had more difficulty than the former.

During the  Kyoto negotiations, Brazil made a suggestion that has since become known as the Brazilian Proposal.
Its idea was that countries should now share the burden of emissions cuts according to how historically responsible they were for the problem.
In other words, we should calculate what concentration of greenhouse gases each country has put into the atmosphere over time and use those figures to allocate emissions cuts.
That would mean, for instance, that countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom, which have been emitting for longer than most countries, would bear a larger share than their current emissions implied.
Greenhouse gases have been known to absorb heat and hold this heat in the atmosphere, instead of reflecting it back into space.
It would also mean that big emitters that had developed their industries more recently, such as Australia, would bear less of a share.

It started out like any other day.
I had no idea that I was in for one of the most terrifying experiences of my life.
I headed to the beach and jumped on my surfboard and paddled out.
I was about  yards off the beach, when I felt a sudden chill in the air followed by an uncomfortable stillness.
Suddenly, I heard the lifeguard scream, “Get out of the water” There was a certain panic in his voice that demanded attention.
Then I saw something approaching me in the water.
It was big and gray, and closing in on me fast.
I tried to paddle back to shore but my arms and legs were paralyzed.

Many people use their cleverness to justify and excuse themselves for the messiness of their workspaces.
They say things like, “I know where everything is.” Or they say nonhumorous things such as, “A clean desk is a sign of a sick mind.” However, people who say they know where everything is turn out to be using a large amount of their mental capacity and creative energies remembering where they placed things, rather than doing the job.
If they worked in a wellorganized environment for any length of time, they would be surprised at how much more productive they were.
If you have a tendency to attempt to explain a messy desk or work area, challenge yourself to work with a clean desk for an entire day.
The result will amaze you.

The term euphemism derives from a Greek word meaning ‘to speak with good words’ and involves substituting a more pleasant, less objectionable way of saying something for a blunt or more direct way.
Why do people use euphemisms They do so probably to help smooth out the ‘rough edges’ of life, to make the unbearable bearable and the offensive inoffensive.
(A), euphemisms can become dangerous when they are used to create misperceptions of important issues.
(B), a politician may indicate that one of his statements was ‘somewhat at variance with the truth,’ meaning that he lied.
Even more serious examples include describing rotting slums as ‘substandard housing,’ making the miserable conditions appear reasonable and the need for action less important.(A)(B)

Until the ’s, there were only three competitive swimming strokes freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke  and each had specific rules that described how it was to be performed.
The rules of breaststroke stated that both arms must be pulled together underwater and then recovered simultaneously back to the start of the pulling position to begin the next stroke.
Most people interpreted this arm recovery to mean an underwater recovery.
In the ’s, however, someone challenged the rules and reinterpreted this arm recovery to be an outofthewater recovery.
Since this new breaststroke was about slower, people using the conventional version couldn’t effectively compete.
Something had to be done to solve the problem.
Finally, this new stroke now known as the ‘butterfly’ won recognition as the fourth swimming stroke, and became an Olympic event in .() ()

Living things naturally return to a state of balance.
When we are disturbed by forces acting on us, our inner machinery kicks in and returns us to a balanced state of equilibrium.
Homeostasis is the word we use to describe the ability of an organism to maintain internal equilibrium by adjusting its physiological processes.
Most of the systems in animal and human physiology are controlled by homeostasis.
We don’t like to be off balance.
We tend to keep things in a stable condition.
This system operates at all levels.
Our blood stays the same temperature.
Except for extraordinary exceptions, when people find ways to intervene using methods more powerful than our tendency to equilibrium, our habits, behaviors, thoughts, and our quality of life stay pretty much the same too.

Marking the NepalTibet border, Everest looms as a threesided pyramid of gleaming ice and dark rock.
The first eight expeditions to Everest were British, all of which attempted the mountain from the northern, Tibetan, side ― not because it presented the most obvious weakness in the peak’s formidable defenses but because in  the Tibetan government opened its borders to foreigners, while Nepal remained off limits.
The first Everesters were obliged to trek  miles from Darjeeling across the Tibetan plateau to reach the foot of the mountain.
Their knowledge of the deadly effects of extreme altitude was limited and their equipment was poor.
Yet in , a member of the third British expedition, Edward Felix Norton, reached an elevation of , feet ― just  feet below the summit ― before being defeated by exhaustion and snow blindness.
It was an astounding achievement that was not surpassed for  years.

Giorgio Vasari, the Italian painter, architect, and writer, was born in Arezzo in .
He was considered to be more successful as an architect than a painter.
But what made him truly famous was his book Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects (shortened as Lives).
It is not known exactly how many copies of the first edition of Lives, published in , were printed, but it earned Vasari the praise of his peers.
Then in a revised edition of Lives in , complete with portraits of the artists, he combined biographical anecdotes with critical comment.
Although the revised edition overshadowed Vasari’s own achievements as a painter and architect, it made him the most respected man of the Italian art world.
He was even knighted by Pope Pius  in .

The good news is that it’s never too late to start building up muscle strength, regardless of your age.
Ideally, though, it’s best to start in your midforties when muscle mass starts to decline significantly.
“Once you’ve started, it can take just six weeks to see an improvement of up to  percent in your muscle capabilities,” says Dr.
Ward.
Studies have found that intense programs of strength training can help even weak older people double their strength, as well as enable them to walk faster and climb stairs more easily.
And muscle isn’t all you gain ― strength training can help combat osteoarthritis, depression, and risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.

Emotional eaters manifest their problem in lots of different ways.
For many people, one of the classic signs of emotional eating is night eating.
Night eaters are often eating in response to anxiety or to the emotional turmoil they’ve experienced throughout the day.
Boredom and loneliness are also more likely to come to the surface when the rush of the day is done and the night stretches ahead.
Sometimes emotional eating is a reaction to a specific situation.
You had a bad day at work.
The kids have been so demanding that you are completely worn out.
You and your significant other are fighting.
It doesn’t matter what the circumstances are; the end result is that  times out of  you end up on the couch with a bowl of chips or bag of cookies in your hand, telling yourself it’s the only way you can relax.

The DNA extracted from these bits of whale skin not only identifies the individuals in the group, but also reveals their relationships to each other.
Sperm whales travel in social groups that cooperate to defend and protect each other, and may even share suckling of calves.
( ) It is difficult to determine the membership of these groups from sightings alone, because of the practical difficulties of observing whale behavior, most of which happens underwater.
( ) To make things even more difficult, sperm whales can travel across entire oceans and can dive to a depth of a kilometer.
  ( ) Biologists who study whale behavior generally have to be content with hanging around in boats, waiting for their subjects to surface.
( ) But when they do surface, in addition to taking photos which allow individual whales to be identified, biologists can zip over in worryingly small boats and pick up the bits of skin that the whales leave behind on the surface when they resubmerge.
( ) This has allowed researchers to describe sperm whale social groups in detail.

Mediation is a process that has much in common with advocacy but is also crucially different.
It parallels advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of negotiation, but differs in so far as mediation involves adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties  rather than taking up the case of one party against another.
At times, particularly in very complex situations, the processes of advocacy and mediation can overlap, perhaps with very problematic results, as one loses clarity over his or her role.
It is therefore important, if not essential, to maintain a clear focus in undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure that the roles do not become blurred and therefore potentially counterproductive.
For example, a mediator who ‘takes sides’ is likely to lose all credibility, as is an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position.Although both deal with negotiation, a mediator needs to maintain (A) and an advocate partiality in order to (B) crossing over into each other’s role.

(A)When I was a freshman in high school, I won second prize in our local newspaper’s essay contest on the theme of ‘future career.’ I wrote about wanting to become a journalist.
We had to collect our prizes at the local variety store and, while waiting in line, a little notebook in the stationery department caught my eye.
(a) It was a black and red hardcover book with the word ‘Record’ neatly engraved in gold on the cover.
I reasoned that since I was going to be a journalist, I’d need a very special notebook in which to write.
So I bought (b) it.(B)Then during a serious illness when I was thirtyfive, I found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years earlier.
From my sick bed I noticed (c) it on a nearby shelf.
It was still blank but something told me to write my deepest feelings and thoughts, my pain and fear, my wishes and dreams, the words of my inner world.
This was my first ‘official’ journal.
And the process of journalkeeping through writing and drawing helped heal me from a mysterious illness which had defied the doctors and their medicines.(C)My life changed so much after that.
I began listening to my own feelings and inner wisdom.
The insights I gained through journalkeeping led me into a new career as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing.
More importantly, I learned to play and enjoy life again.
For instance, several years after recovering from my illness, I started skateboarding for the first time in my life and loved (d) it.
I’m grateful to that high school girl that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank book.
I used it to save my life and to help others.(D)But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about (e) it and about becoming a journalist.
Painting became my great love.
Upon graduating from high school, I went to college as a fine art major and English minor.
After becoming a professional artist, marriage followed, then the birth of two daughters.
A career change came next which led to teaching underprivileged young children in Los Angeles.

Since the beginning of time, the mysterious nature of dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were messages from the other world.
Dreams have been regarded as prophetic communications which, when properly decoded, would enable us to foretell the future.
There is, however, absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory.
It is certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a traumatic event, such as the threat of the loss of a loved one who is sick, will dream about that loved one more than would otherwise be the case.
If the dreamer then calls and finds that the loved one has died, it is understandable for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition of that death.
But this is a mistake.
It is simply a(n)  correspondence between a situation about which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the event that one fears.To prove the existence of premonitory dreams, scientific evidence must be obtained.
We would need to do studies in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream life and judges are asked to make correspondences between these dream events and events that occurred in real life.
A problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples of ‘hits,’ but they never tell you how many of their premonitory dreams ‘missed.’ To do a scientific study of dream prophecy, we would need to establish some base of how commonly  correspondences occur between dream and waking reality.
Until we have that evidence, it is better to believe that the assumption is false.
