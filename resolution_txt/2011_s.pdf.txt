My wife and I have enjoyed receiving your publication for years.
Unfortunately, our jobs now have us both traveling most weeks, and we simply cannot keep up with a daily paper.
So we would like to request that you stop delivery to our home.
If you have questions about this matter, please leave a message at () , and either my wife or I will call you back as soon as we can.
Thank you for years of reliable delivery of a firstrate newspaper.
If our situation changes, we will call you to resume delivery.
In the meantime, we will expect delivery to stop no later than the end of this week.

The word ‘courage’ takes on added meaning if you keep in mind that it is derived from the Latin word ‘cor’ meaning ‘heart.’ The dictionary defines courage as a ‘quality which enables one to pursue a right course of action, through  which one may provoke disapproval, hostility, or contempt.’ Over  years ago La Rochefoucauld went a step further when he said “Perfect courage is to do unwitnessed what we should be capable of doing before all men.” It is not easy to show moral courage in the face of either indifference or opposition.
But persons who are daring in taking a wholehearted stand for truth often achieving results that surpass their expectations.
On the other hand, halfhearted individuals are seldom distinguished for courage even when it involves their own welfare.
To be courageous under all circumstances requires strong determination.

Consider the following implication involving the role of social bonds and affection among group members.
If strong bonds make even a single dissent less likely, the performance of groups and institutions will be impaired.
A study of investment clubs showed that the worstperforming clubs were built on affective ties and were primarily social, while the bestperforming clubs limited social connections and focused on making money.
Dissent was far more frequent in the highperforming clubs.
The low performers usually voted unanimously, with little open debate.
As illustrated in the study, the high performers placed more importance on social bonds than the low performers, resulting in their high rate of success.
The central problem is that the voters in lowperforming groups were trying to build social cohesion rather than to produce the highest returns.

I have always taught my children that politeness, learning, and order are good things, and that something good is to be desired and developed for its own sake.
But at school they learned, and very quickly, that children earn Nature Trail tickets for running the quartermile track during lunch recess.
Or Lincoln Dollars for picking up trash on the playground or for helping a young child find the bathroom― deeds that used to be called ‘good citizenship.’ Why is it necessary to buy the minimal cooperation of children with rewards and treats What disturbs me is the idea that good behavior must be reinforced with incentives.
Children must be taught to perform good deeds for their own sake, not in order to receive stickers, stars, and candy bars.

In a classic set of studies over a tenyear period, biologist Gerald Wilkinson found that, when vampire bats return to their communal nests from a successful night’s foraging, they frequently vomit blood and share it with other nestmates, including even nonrelatives.
The reason, it turns out, is that bloodsharing greatly improves each bat’s chances of survival.
A bat that fails to feed for two nights is likely to die.
Wilkinson showed that the blood donors are typically sharing their surpluses and, in so doing, are saving unsuccessful foragers that are close to starvation.
So the costs are relatively low and the benefits are relatively high.
Since no bat can be certain of success on any given night, it is likely that the donor will itself eventually need help from some nestmate.
In effect, the vampire bats have created a kind of                    .

Jess took another step forward.
The ground fell with unexpected sharpness, and the water level seemed to jump from her knees to her waist.
She stopped for a moment and anxiously scanned the river before her.
Her legs started to shake and she felt her body stiffen.
And this was an unknown river.
There could be reeds, or other dangers she didn’t know about.
She was concerned that as a townie, she’d had little experience of the countryside, and none at all of swimming in rivers.
It didn’t look safe enough but she didn’t want to turn back.
She took a deep breath and pushed herself into the water.
It felt nice and cool, not as freezing as when she had first stepped into it.
The water seemed to welcome and embrace her.
She liked the clean, luxuriant feeling as she swept down with the current.

Many people take numerous photos while traveling or on vacation or during significant life celebrations to preserve the experience for the future.
But the role of photographer may actually detract from their delight in the present moment.
I know a father who devoted himself earnestly to photographing the birth of his first and only child.
The photos were beautiful but, he lamented afterward he felt that he had missed out on the most important first moment of his son’s life.
Looking through the camera lens made him detached from the scene.
He was just an observer, not an experiencer.
Teach yourself to use your camera in a way that neglects your ongoing experiences, by truly looking at things and noticing what is beautiful and meaningful.() ()

No matter how good your product is, remember that perfection of an existing product is not necessarily the best investment one can make.(A), the Erie Canal, which took four years to build, was regarded as the height of efficiency in its day.
What its builders had not considered was that the advent of the railroad would assure the canal’s instant downfall.
By the time the canal was finished, the railroad had been established as the fittest technology for transportation.(B), when the fuel cell becomes the automotive engine of choice, the car companies focusing on increasing the efficiency of the internal combustion engine may find themselves left behind.

Experienced writers invariably write in a climate of discussion.
Their writing is usually embedded in a context of others’ ideas and opinions.
Many writers, especially in the academic community, are directly responding to other writers ―a scientist reexamining the experimental procedures of other scientists; a literary critic taking exception to a prevailing method of interpretation; a sociologist offering an alternative explanation of a colleague’s data; a historian participating as respondent in a conference.
Such people are not writing in a vacuum.
Their ideas often originate in discussion, their writing is a response to discussion, and their papers are designed to stimulate further discussion.

Around  B.C.
there lived in Greece a very famous painter named Apelles.
It was his practice to conceal himself at previews of his paintings in order to hear the public’s opinions of his masterpieces.
At one such preview a bootmaker criticized the shoes in a painting on which Apelles had labored long and hard.
After correcting the picture the painter arranged a second preview.
This time the bootmaker began to criticize the anatomy of one of the characters.
Apelles was unable to restrain himself, for he knew that the criticism was unjust and the man knew nothing about anatomy.
From his hiding place Apelles shouted, “Bootmaker, stick to your last” From that time it has been the custom to ridicule the people who act like they know what they do not with the pointed caution, “Stick to your last”

Bristlecone pines are unusual trees that grow in the mountain regions of western America, sometimes as high as two or more miles above sea level.
They grow very slowly and range from  to  feet in height.
These evergreens often live for thousands of years.
Considering the habitat of these trees, such as rocky areas where the soil is poor and precipitation is slight, it seems almost incredible that they should live so long or even survive at all.
The environmental adversities, however, actually contribute to their longevity.
Cells that are produced as a result of these conditions are densely arranged.
The densely structured wood is resistant to invasion by insects and other potential pests.
Bristlecone pines grow faster in richer conditions, but die earlier and soon decay.
The harshness of their surroundings, then, is a vital factor in making them strong and sturdy.

Most people attack a new problem by relying heavily on the tools and skills that are most familiar to them.
While this approach can work well for problems that are similar to those previously solved, it often fails, and fails miserably, when a new problem is particularly novel.
In this circumstance, it is best to assume nothing and treat the problem as if you have never seen anything like it before.
In martial arts, this sense of looking freshly at something is known as ‘beginner’s mind.’ Beginners to any art don’t know what is important and what is irrelevant, so they try to absorb every detail.
Experienced martial artists use their experience as a filter to separate the essential from the irrelevant.
When that filter mistakenly screens out something essential, then even seasoned masters can make mistakes.

University students in several of my seminar classes sat in a circle and each student took turns telling the others his or her name.
At the end of the round of introductions, the students were asked to write down the names of as many other students as they could remember.
In almost every case, students wrote down the names of students that were seated far away from them.
However, surprisingly, they weren’t able to recall the names of students who were seated close to them.
This effect was worst for the students who sat on either side of them.
What was the reason for such findings The student who was next in line for an introduction was clearly on edge and after finishing his or her introduction, he or she was preoccupied with calming his or her nerves.
The effect was clearly due to the social anxiety they experienced immediately before and after having to introduce themselves to the entire group.

The body has been viewed as a ‘natural’ phenomenon― a fixed, unchanging fact of nature.
Recently, however, it is also being seen as a part of culture in the sense that it can be socially defined in different ways.(A) It has also opened up new questions and issues in the sociology of sport.
Some people in the sociology of sport are now working with colleagues in other disciplines who share interests in the body.(B) Social definitions of the body are grounded in social relations and influenced by those with the power to promote agreement about what should be considered ‘natural’ when it comes to the body.
This new way of thinking about the body has challenged the traditional mindbody split that has characterized Western thought since the time of Plato.(C) In their work they are asking critical questions about how the body is trained, disciplined, and manipulated in sports and how some sport scientists are using technology to probe, monitor, test, evaluate, and rehabilitate the body as a performance machine.

However, recent success in the packagedcookie market suggests that these may not be the only, or perhaps even the most important, reasons.Why eat a cookie Some reasons might be to satisfy your hunger, to increase your sugar level, or just to have something to chew on.
( ) It appears that cookieproducing companies are becoming aware of some other influences and, as a result, are delivering to the market products resulting from their awareness.
( ) These relatively new product offerings are usually referred to as ‘soft’ or ‘chewy’ cookies, to distinguish them from the more typical crunchy varieties.
( ) Why all the fuss over their introduction ( ) Apparently much of their appeal has to do with childhood memories of sitting on the back steps devouring those meltinyourmouth cookies that were delivered by Mom straight from the oven, while they were still soft.
 ( ) This emotional and sensory appeal of soft cookies is apparently at least as strong as are the physical cravings that the product satisfies.

Unlike the modern society, the primitive society has less specialized knowledge to transmit, and since its way of life is enacted before the eyes of all, it has no need to create a separate institution of education such as the school.
Instead, the child acquires the heritage of his culture by observing and imitating adults in such activities as rituals, hunts, festivals, cultivation, and harvesting.
As a result, there is little or none of that alienation of young from old so marked in modern industrial societies.
A further reason for this alienation in modern societies is that in his conception of reality the modern adult owes less to his direct experience and more to the experience of his culture than does primitive man.
Clearly, his debt to culture will vary with the nature of his education.
Hence, the contemporary child must travel much further than the offspring of primitive man to acquire the world view of his elders.
He is, therefore, that much more removed from the adults of his society.
Unlike the primitive child who learns from his (A) surroundings, the modern child learns in educational institutions, which results in (B)from his elders.(A)(B)

Many people believe that it is critical to share similar, if not identical, beliefs and values with someone with whom they have a relationship.
While this may seem preferable, it is far from mandatory.
Individuals from extremely diverse backgrounds have learned to overlook their differences and live harmonious, loving lives together.
I’ve seen people from opposite ends of the spectrum economically and politically that ended up in happy, lasting marriages.
I’ve seen couples from different ethnic groups merge into harmonious relationships, and I’ve seen people from different religions come together for a strong, lasting bond.
Furthermore, many good friends have little in common except a warm loving feeling of respect and rapport.
That’s the only essential thing.People who enjoy the best relationships with others, who live life with the least frustration regarding their differences, have learned that differences are to be expected, a fact of life.
This understanding must go beyond a mere intellectual ‘I know we’re all different.’ You must truly own this idea and incorporate it into your daily life.
The way I see it, we have only two realistic choices.
We can              the principle of separate realities and remain frustrated and angry over the fact that no one seems to conform to our way of thinking, or we can strive to understand what in Eastern philosophy is called ‘the way of things.’ Separate realities is the way things really are.
Everyone is unique and has different gifts to offer.
When we look for these gifts we will surely find them ― and in doing so, we will open the door to a world of personal growth.

(A)After several futile attempts to teach the role of theme, or the prominent repeated melody, in classical music, the teacher was at wit’s end.
Having reminded her students many times that composers like Wagner depended on the listeners’ remembering the earlier theme to recognize its later use, (a) she was determined to make her students understand that themes recur throughout a piece.
(B)She knew that her class had little trouble with simple variations and could easily identify themes that were repeated in a similar way.
But when the theme showed much variation, the students’ attention focused on the new detail to such an extent that they no longer ‘heard’ the basic theme.
For a week or two, the teacher worried about the problem.
Other teachers advised (b) her to go on with something else, but she continued to search for a solution.(C) The following day in class, (c) she asked how many students had tape recorders.
A dozen or so students said, “I do.” The teacher said excitedly, “I have an idea.
Let’s play Beethoven’s Eroica again.
One of you can record the theme when it’s first introduced.
Then later, someone else can record it the second time it appears.
Finally, we’ll have another person record when it appears next.
Then we can start all three tape recorders at exactly the same time to see if the recordings fit” Her students looked at (d) her in surprise.
Suddenly, however, delight appeared on their faces.
And so it was done.
When they played the recordings simultaneously, the sounds blended sufficiently for the students to recognize their commonality.(D)With this problem in mind, one afternoon during the lunch hour, she noticed a group of students gathered in a corner of the school yard.
