Obviously, one of the judgments the public has of us is whether or not our telephone service is good.
Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want.
That, however, is not all they want.
They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want.
They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations.
In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.

On the path to excellence, some obstacles may initially seem overwhelming.
Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world.
If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong.
Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that.
If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning.
With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.

For many years now, mediated entertainment such as TV and film has been able to stimulate our optical and auditory senses with sights and sounds.
Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell.
The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him.
Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects.
Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch.
New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hanggliding experience across the countryside.
Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.

Recently, researchers have suggested that the purpose of laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful state, but to actually induce this state in others as well.
According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits.
In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities.
This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.

During her childhood years, the artist Tammy Rahr spent a lot of time outdoors making things from flowers and dirt.
Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles, California.
The experience made her more aware of what was going on in the world.
After returning to New York State with her family, Tammy faced another lesson in growing up.
A gifted student, she was sent to college when she was just .
Tammy was able to earn her high school diploma and some college credit before trying her hand at a number of different jobs.
Eventually, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts.
After graduating from the institute, she remained active with it and the museum there.

In the twentieth century, advances in technology, from refrigeration to sophisticated ovens to air transportation that carries fresh ingredients around the world, contributed immeasurably to baking and pastry making.
At the beginning of the twentyfirst century, the popularity of fine breads and pastries are growing even faster than new chefs can be trained.
Interestingly enough, many of the technological advances in bread making have sparked a reaction among bakers and consumers alike.
They are looking to reclaim some of the flavors of oldfashioned breads that were lost as baking became more industrialized and baked goods became more refined, standardized, and ― some would say ― flavorless.
Bakers are researching methods for producing the handmade sourdough breads of the past, and they are experimenting with specialty flours in their search for flavor.

Although children watch television at various times, the programming that they view alone tends to be specifically aimed at children.
In the United States particularly, most of the advertising during this segment consists of ads for food, particularly sugared food.
During the runup to Christmas, (A) increasing  decreasing numbers of ads concern toys and games.
Such practices are believed to put pressure on parents to yield to what the media have dubbed “pester power.” This has led to calls for legislation to (B) promote  regulate advertising in Europe and the United States.

The true champion recognizes that excellence often flows most smoothly from, a fact that can get lost in these hightech days.
I used to train with a worldclass runner who was constantly hooking himself up to pulse meters and pace keepers.
He spent hours collecting data that he thought would help him improve.
In fact, a good  percent of his athletic time was devoted to externals other than working out.
Sports became so complex for him that he forgot how to enjoy himself.
Contrast his approach with that of the late Abebe Bikila, the Ethiopian who won the  Olympic Marathon running barefoot.
Hightech clothing and digital watches were not part of his world.
Abebe Bikila simply ran.
Many times in running, and in other areas of life, less is more.

When there is a discrepancy between the verbal message and the nonverbal message, the latter typically weighs more in forming a judgment.(A), a friend might react to a plan for dinner with a comment like “that’s good,” but with little vocal enthusiasm and a muted facial expression.
In spite of the verbal comment, the lack of expressive enthusiasm suggests that the plan isn’t viewed very positively.
In such a case, the purpose of the positive comment might be to avoid a disagreement and support the friend, but the lack of a positive expression unintentionally leaks a more candid, negative reaction to the plan.
Of course, the muted expressive display might also be strategic and intentional.(B), the nonverbal message is deliberate, but designed to let the partner know one’s candid reaction indirectly.
It is then the partner’s responsibility to interpret the nonverbal message and make some adjustment in the plan.(A)(B)

Early one night in  in my old and cheap apartment in Bangor, Maine, I got a phone call from my agent, Bill, who was helping me publish my first novel.
“Are you sitting down” Bill asked.
“No,” I said.
“Do I need to” “You might,” he said.
“The publication rights for your book were sold for four hundred thousand dollars” I was completely speechless.
That amount of money was beyond my wildest expectations.
I was sure I hadn’t heard him right.
I couldn’t have.
I asked, “Did you say it went for forty thousand dollars” Bill said it again as clearly as he could, “Four hundred thousand dollars.
Congratulations, Steve.” “Are you sure, Bill” I said in disbelief.
He said he was.
We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t remember a single word of what we said.

Music can convey the scope of a film, effectively communicating whether the motion picture is an epic drama or a story that exists on a more personal scale.
Music can convey the quality and size of a space.
For example, in Alien and Olivier’s Hamlet, the music serves at times to make small andor artificial spaces seem more grand and to enhance the sense of realism.
In addition, music can establish a narrative’s placement in time.
Music for motion pictures often serves to authenticate the era or to provide a sense of nostalgia.
Music has traditionally been classified by musical instruments.
Examples of the former would include Amadeus and Immortal Beloved, while a sense of nostalgia is communicated through the music selected for films such as American Graffiti and The Big Chill..
It is difficult to appreciate what a temperature of ,, means.
If the solar surface, not the center, were as hot as this, the radiation emitted into space would be so great that the whole Earth would be vaporized within a few minutes.
Indeed, this is just what would happen if some cosmic giant were to peel off the outer layers of the Sun like skinning an orange, for the tremendously hot inner regions would then be exposed.
It is believed that the brightness of the Sun can be predicted theoretically.
Fortunately, no such circumstance is possible, and the outer layers of the Sun provide a sort of blanket that protects us from its inner fires.
Yet in spite of these blanketing layers, some energy must leak through from the Sun’s center to its outer regions, and this leakage is of just the right amount to compensate for the radiation emitted by the surface into surrounding space.

On that first night to myself, Dad entrusted me with his movie projector and all the reels of film.
(A) Then I can play the film backward and watch the cat fly down to the floor and see all the splashes of ice cream slurp themselves back into the dish.
I made Simon jump in and out several times before I watched the rest of the film.(B) He said I could do everything myself that night.
So I set up the screen at one end of the living room.
I turned on the projector, turned off the light, put the bowl of popcorn in my lap, and settled in to watch the film labeled HATTIE.(C) It’s one of my favorites because my third birthday party is on it and I can watch our old cat Simon jump up on the dining room table and land in a dish of ice cream.

But no one, even your child, is exactly like you.Parents often believe that they are providing help to their children when they constantly correct and criticize them, assuming that they will grow from these remarks.
But ask yourself Do you like being corrected Do you grow when you are constantly criticized ( ) In truth, we tend to stay the same when we are criticized.
( ) We want to defend what we have done, and our innate stubbornness refuses to permit us to accept the criticism we are receiving.
( ) Behind virtually all criticism is the sentence “If only you were more like me, and living life as I see it, you would be a lot better off.” ( ) Praise your children for attempting a task, even if it was unsuccessful, and for taking risks.
( ) Create an environment in which your children know that you are with them in their efforts, rather than looking to criticize them.

An ant turns right, left, and moves ahead over a sandy hill.
How can we explain the complexity of the path it chose We can think up a sophisticated program in the ant’s brain, but it does not work.
What we have overlooked is the ant’s environment.
The ant may be following a simple rule get out of the sun and back to the nest.
Complex behavior does not imply complex mental strategies.
The same holds for humans.
The apparent complexity of a man’s behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which he finds himself.
People adapt to their environments much as gelatin does; if you wish to know what form it will have when it solidifies, study the shape of the mold that holds the gelatin.

When someone asks us, “How does that work” or “Why does that happen” we tend to answer the question directly if we know the answer.
After all, it is efficient.
Another person asks a question; we provide the answer to the question.
It is usually a winwin.
The problem with this is that the direct approach can have an unintended consequence the loss of confidence.
Although the question wanted for an explanation, what the asker received was a statement of fact.
Why does oil float on top of water in a glass Relative density.
What causes climate change Increased CO in the atmosphere.
Why does the ocean have tides The moon.
Giving direct, accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer.
But in reality, it can shut the asker down.
A statement of fact with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take the next step.
If the asker isn’t familiar with relative density or CO, he or she is likely to move on rather than ask a followup question or probe for related ideas.
Any hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost.
This is a failure in the form of a lost opportunity.
Although direct answers are often needed and wellplaced, they do not work universally.
A skilled explainer learns to see the intent behind the question and formulate an answer that focuses on understanding instead of.

(A)It was my last football game as a college player.
I made the final tackle and we won.
As people chanted my name, (a) I was carried off the field on the shoulders of my teammates.
Although I wasn’t a great student or a great football player, I ended up not only graduating from my dream university but becoming a hero of the team.
People keep asking me how I did it.
Here is my story.(B)It was so hard to break out of the box, but (b) I began to feel an urgent need for a change.
I signed up for the Army and went to the Vietnam War.
A lot of people were worried, but I said, “Well, I’m going to get out of my box by deciding what to do myself instead of having someone else tell (c) me what to do.” With that one crucial shift in thinking, my whole attitude changed.
I began to dream of going to one of the best universities in the country and playing football.
 (C)I was born into a large poor family in Chicago.
As a kid, I had visions of being a hero ― a police officer or an astronaut.
However, people would always tell me, “You can’t do that.
You aren’t smart enough.
You aren’t strong enough.” Moreover, (d) I didn’t do well in school, and I had no hope of getting into any college.
After high school, I gave up on my dream of going to college and got a parttime job instead.
I felt like I was living in a box labeled “This is where you belong.”  (D)After I finished my time in the Army, I packed my bags and went to my dream university.
I knocked on the door of one of the professors’ offices and said, “Please, tell me how to get in here.” The professor could see that I was determined.
He said, “I can’t let you in the university, but (e) I will see you whenever you need my advice or help.” It took me a long time, but I eventually got into that university, became a football player, and graduated.
