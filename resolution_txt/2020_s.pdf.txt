Dear Mr.
 Kayne,I am a resident of Cansinghill Apartments, located right next to the newly opened Vuenna Dog Park.
 As I live with three dogs, I am very happy to let my dogs run around and safely play with other dogs from the neighborhood.
 However, the noise of barking and yelling from the park at night is so loud and disturbing that I cannot relax in my apartment.
 Many of my apartment neighbors also seriously complain about this noise.
 I want immediate action to solve this urgent problem.
 Since you are the manager of Vuenna Dog Park, I ask you to take measures to prevent the noise at night.
 I hope to hear from you soon.
Sincerely,Monty Kim

 Looking out the bus window, Jonas could not stay calm.
 He had been looking forward to this field trip.
 It was the first field trip for his history course.
 His history professor had recommended it to the class, and Jonas had signed up enthusiastically.
 He was the first to board the bus in the morning.
 The landscape looked fascinating as the bus headed to Alsace.
 Finally arriving in Alsace after three hours on the road, however, Jonas saw nothing but endless agricultural fields.
 The fields were vast, but hardly appealed to him.
 He had expected to see some old castles and historical monuments, but now he saw nothing like that awaiting him.
 What can I learn from these boring fields.
 Jonas said to himself with a sigh.

Probably the biggest roadblock to play for adults is the worry that they will look silly, improper, or dumb if they allow themselves to truly play.
 Or they think that it is irresponsible, immature, and childish to give themselves regularly over to play.
 Nonsense and silliness come naturally to kids, but they get pounded out by norms that look down on frivolity.
 This is particularly true for people who have been valued for performance standards set by parents or the educational system, or measured by other cultural norms that are internalized and no longer questioned.
 If someone has spent his adult life worried about always appearing respectable, competent, and knowledgeable, it can be hard to let go sometimes and become physically and emotionally free.
 The thing is this You have to give yourself permission to improvise, to mimic, to take on a longhidden identity.

 Any learning environment that deals with only the database instincts or only the improvisatory instincts ignores one half of our ability.
 It is bound to fail.
 It makes me think of jazz guitarists Theyre not going to make it if they know a lot about music theory but dont know how to jam in a live concert.
 Some schools and workplaces emphasize a stable, rotelearned database.
 They ignore the improvisatory instincts drilled into us for millions of years.
 Creativity suffers.
 Others emphasize creative usage of a database, without installing a fund of knowledge in the first place.
 They ignore our need to obtain a deep understanding of a subject, which includes memorizing and storing a richly structured database.
 You get people who are great improvisers but dont have depth of knowledge.
 You may know someone like this where you work.
 They may look like jazz musicians and have the appearance of jamming, but in the end they know nothing.
 Theyre playing intellectual air guitar.

In retrospect, it might seem surprising that something as mundane as the desire to count sheep was the driving force for an advance as fundamental as written language.
 But the desire for written records has always accompanied economic activity, since transactions are meaningless unless you can clearly keep track of who owns what.
 As such, early human writing is dominated by wheeling and dealing a collection of bets, bills, and contracts.
 Long before we had the writings of the prophets, we had the writings of the profits.
 In fact, many civilizations never got to the stage of recording and leaving behind the kinds of great literary works that we often associate with the history of culture.
 What survives these ancient societies is, for the most part, a pile of receipts.
 If it werent for the commercial enterprises that produced those records, we would know far, far less about the cultures that they came from.

Human beings do not enter the world as competent moral agents.
 Nor does everyone leave the world in that state.
 But somewhere in between, most people acquire a bit of decency that qualifies them for membership in the community of moral agents.
 Genes, development, and learning all contribute to the process of becoming a decent human being.
 The interaction between nature and nurture is, however, highly complex, and developmental biologists are only just beginning to grasp just how complex it is.
 Without the context provided by cells, organisms, social groups, and culture, DNA is inert.
 Anyone who says that people are genetically programmed to be moral has an oversimplified view of how genes work.
 Genes and environment interact in ways that make it nonsensical to think that the process of moral development in children, or any other developmental process, can be discussed in terms of nature versus nurture.
 Developmental biologists now know that it is really both, or nature through nurture.
 A complete scientific explanation of moral evolution and development in the human species is a very long way off.

Invasions of natural communities by nonindigenous species are currently rated as one of the most important globalscale environmental problems.
 The loss of biodiversity has generated concern over the consequences for ecosystem functioning and thus understanding the relationship between both has become a major focus in ecological research during the last two decades.
 The biodiversityinvasibility hypothesis by Elton suggests that high diversity increases the competitive environment of communities and makes them more difficult to invade.
 Numerous biodiversity experiments have been conducted since Eltons time and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the often observed negative relationship between diversity and invasibility.
 Beside the decreased chance of empty ecological niches but the increased probability of competitors that prevent invasion success, diverse communities are assumed to use resources more completely and, therefore, limit the ability of invaders to establish.
 Further, more diverse communities are believed to be more stable because they use a broader range of niches than speciespoor communities.

The Nuer are one of the largest ethnic groups in South Sudan, primarily residing in the Nile River Valley.
 The Nuer are a cattleraising people, whose everyday lives revolve around their cattle.
 They have various terms related to cattle, so they can distinguish between hundreds of types of cows, based on color, markings, and shape of horns.
 They prefer to be called by the names of the cattle they raise.
 The commonest daily foods for the Nuer are dairy products, especially milk for the young and soured milk, like yogurt, for adults.
 And wild fruits and nuts are favorite snacks for the Nuer.
 The Nuer also have a culture of counting only older members of the family.
 They believe that counting the number of children one has could result in misfortune and prefer to report fewer children than they have.

 Speculations about the meaning and purpose of prehistoric art rely heavily on analogies drawn with modernday huntergatherer societies.
 Such primitive societies, as Steven Mithen emphasizes in The Prehistory of the Modern Mind, tend to view man and beast, animal and plant, organic and inorganic spheres, as participants in an integrated, animated totality.
 The dual expressions of this tendency are anthropomorphism the practice of regarding animals as humans and totemism the practice of regarding humans as animals, both of which spread through the visual art and the mythology of primitive cultures.
 Thus the natural world is conceptualized in terms of human social relations.
 When considered in this light, the visual preoccupation of early humans with the nonhuman creatures inhabited their world becomes profoundly meaningful.
 Among huntergatherers, animals are not only good to eat, they are also good to think about, as Claude LviStrauss has observed.
 In the practice of totemism, he has suggested, an unlettered humanity broods upon itself and its place in nature.

 Suppose we know that Paula suffers from a severe phobia.
 If we reason that Paula is afraid either of snakes or spiders, and then establish that she is not afraid of snakes, we will conclude that Paula is afraid of spiders.
 However, our conclusion is reasonable only if Paulas fear really does concern either snakes or spiders.
 If we know only that Paula has a phobia, then the fact that shes not afraid of snakes is entirely consistent with her being afraid of heights, water, dogs or the number thirteen.
 More generally, when we are presented with a list of alternative explanations for some phenomenon, and are then persuaded that all but one of those explanations are unsatisfactory, we should pause to reflect.
 Before denying that the remaining explanation is the correct one, consider whether other plausible options are being ignored or overlooked.
 The fallacy of false choice misleads when were insufficiently attentive to an important hidden assumption, that the choices which have been made explicit exhaust the sensible alternatives.

 The role of science can sometimes be overstated, with its advocates slipping into scientism.
 Scientism is the view that the scientific description of reality is the only truth there is.
 With the advance of science, there has been a tendency to slip into scientism, and assume that any factual claim can be authenticated if and only if the term scientific can correctly be ascribed to it.
 The consequence is that nonscientific approaches to reality  and that can include all the arts, religion, and personal, emotional and valueladen ways of encountering the world  may become labelled as merely subjective, and therefore of little  in terms of describing the way the world is.
 The philosophy of science seeks to avoid crude scientism and get a balanced view on what the scientific method can and cannot achieve.

Although commonsense knowledge may have merit, it also has weaknesses, not the least of which is that it often contradicts itself.
 For example, we hear that people who are similar will like one another Birds of a feather flock together but also that persons who are dissimilar will like each other Opposites attract.
 We are told that groups are wiser and smarter than individuals Two heads are better than one but also that group work inevitably produces poor results Too many cooks spoil the broth.
 Each of these contradictory statements may hold true under particular conditions, but without a clear statement of when they apply and when they do not, aphorisms provide little insight into relations among people.
 That is why we heavily depend on aphorisms whenever we face difficulties and challenges in the long journey of our lives.
 They provide even less guidance in situations where we must make decisions.
 For example, when facing a choice that entails risk, which guideline should we use  Nothing ventured, nothing gained or Better safe than sorry.

Movies may be said to support the dominant culture and to serve as a means for its reproduction over time.
A The bad guys are usually punished the romantic couple almost always find each other despite the obstacles and difficulties they encounter on the path to true love and the way we wish the world to be is how, in the movies, it more often than not winds up being.
 No doubt it is this utopian aspect of movies that accounts for why we enjoy them so much.
B The simple answer to this question is that movies do more than present twohour civics lessons or editorials on responsible behavior.
 They also tell stories that, in the end, we find satisfying.
C But one may ask why audiences would find such movies enjoyable if all they do is give cultural directives and prescriptions for proper living.
 Most of us would likely grow tired of such didactic movies and would probably come to see them as propaganda, similar to the cultural artwork that was common in the Soviet Union and other autocratic societies.

Thus, individuals of many resident species, confronted with the fitness benefits of control over a productive breeding site, may be forced to balance costs in the form of lower nonbreeding survivorship by remaining in the specific habitat where highest breeding success occurs.
 Residentbird habitat selection is seemingly a straightforward process in which a young dispersing individual moves until it finds a place where it can compete successfully to satisfy its needs.
   Initially, these needs include only food and shelter.
   However, eventually, the young must locate, identify, and settle in a habitat that satisfies not only survivorship but reproductive needs as well.
   In some cases, the habitat that provides the best opportunity for survival may not be the same habitat as the one that provides for highest reproductive capacity because of requirements specific to the reproductive period.
   Migrants, however, are free to choose the optimal habitat for survival during the nonbreeding season and for reproduction during the breeding season.
   Thus, habitat selection during these different periods can be quite different for migrants as opposed to residents, even among closely related species.

Still, it is arguable that advertisers worry rather too much about this problem, as advertising in other media has always been fragmented.
 The fragmentation of television audiences during recent decades, which has happened throughout the globe as new channels have been launched everywhere, has caused advertisers much concern.
   Advertisers look back nostalgically to the years when a single spot transmission would be seen by the majority of the population at one fell swoop.
   This made the television advertising of mass consumer products relatively straightforward  not to say easy  whereas today it is necessary for advertisers to build up coverage of their target markets over time, by advertising on a host of channels with separate audiences.
   Moreover, advertisers gain considerable benefits from the price competition between the numerous broadcasting stations.
   And television remains much the fastest way to build up public awareness of a new brand or a new campaign.
   Seldom does a new brand or new campaign that solely uses other media, without using television, reach high levels of public awareness very quickly.

Because elephant groups break up and reunite very frequently  for instance, in response to variation in food availability  reunions are more important in elephant society than among primates.
 And the species has evolved elaborate greeting behaviors, the form of which reflects the strength of the social bond between the individuals much like how you might merely shake hands with a longstanding acquaintance but hug a close friend you have not seen in a while, and maybe even tear up.
 Elephants may greet each other simply by reaching their trunks into each others mouths, possibly equivalent to a human peck on the cheek.
 However, after long absences, members of family and bond groups greet one another with incredibly theatrical displays.
 The fact that the intensity reflects the duration of the separation as well as the level of intimacy suggests that elephants have a sense of time as well.
 To human eyes, these greetings strike a familiar chord.
 Im reminded of the joyous reunions so visible in the arrivals area of an international airport terminal.

For quite some time, science educators believed that handson activities were the answer to childrens understanding through their participation in sciencerelated activities.
 Many teachers believed that students merely engaging in activities and a manipulating objects would organize the information to be gained and the knowledge to be understood into concept comprehension.
 Educators began to notice that the pendulum had swung too far to the handson component of inquiry as they realized that the knowledge was not b inherent in the materials themselves, but in the thought and metacognition about what students had done in the activity.
 We now know that handson is a dangerous phrase when speaking about learning science.
 The c missing ingredient is the mindson part of the instructional experience.
 d Uncertainty about the knowledge intended in any activity comes from each students recreation of concepts  and discussing, thinking, arguing, listening, and evaluating ones own preconceptions after the activities, under the leadership of a thoughtful teacher, can bring this about.
 After all, a food fight is a handson activity, but about all you would learn was something about the aerodynamics of flying mashed potatoes Our view of what students need to build their knowledge and theories about the natural world e extends far beyond a handson activity.
 While it is important for students to use and interact with materials in science class, the learning comes from the sensemaking of students handson experiences.

AThe colors of the trees looked like they were on fire, the reds and oranges competing with the yellows and golds.
 This was Ninas favorite season, but she remained silent for hours while Marie was driving.

 Now a former champion, she was thinking of retiring from boxing.
 Marie, her longtime friend and trainer, shared her pain.

 Hundreds of fish tails were flashing and catching light from the sun, moving upstream.
 Beneath them in the water, they saw salmon slowly moving their bodies.
 DWhile Marie and Nina kept watching the salmon, a big one suddenly leapt.
 It threw itself up and over the rushing water above, but in vain.

 Another jumped, its body spinning until it made it over the falls.
 Another one leapt and was washed back by the power of the water.
