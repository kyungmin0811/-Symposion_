In our efforts to be the good child, the uncomplaining employee, or the cooperative patient, many of us fall into the trap of trying to please people by going along with whatever they want us to do.
At times, we lose track of our own boundaries and needs, and the cost of this could be our life, both symbolically and literally.
When we are unable to set healthy limits, it causes distress in our relationships.
But when we learn to say no to what we don’t feel like doing in order to say yes to our true self, we feel empowered, and our relationships with others improve.
So don’t be afraid to say no.
Try to catch yourself in the moment and use your true voice to say what you really want to say.

Some people punish themselves when they are under time pressure.
They delete all the games on their PC, they stop going for walks, and they don’t spend time with their friends.
They then have less pleasure in life and less balance ― and their work performance actually declines.
Break out of this pattern by paying more attention to relaxation and getting more involved in living when you are under pressure.
Define clear time periods for this half an hour for a walk, ten minutes to play a game on your PC, and so on.
Your mind will become more creative during the break, and you will become mentally fitter.
Free time without feelings of guilt will give you the strength to do highquality work in the remaining time.
Furthermore, a certain amount of recreation reduces the chances of developing stressrelated disorders.

Large animals are actually less dangerous to hikers than smaller ones.
Common sense tells us that we should avoid tigers, bears, and other large threatening animals.
But smaller animals are actually more threatening than bigger animals.
To overcome disadvantages of their size, small animals have developed useful weapons such as poison to protect themselves in the wild.
Each year, only a few people are attacked by tigers or bears, and most of these incidents are caused by the people themselves.
However, more people are killed by bites from small poisonous snakes than by these large animals.
Even more people lose their lives from allergic reactions to common bee stings.
For these reasons, hikers should be careful about small dangerous creatures.

I hope you remember our discussion last Monday about the servicing of the washing machine supplied to us three months ago.
I regret to say the machine is no longer working.
As we agreed during the meeting, please send a service engineer as soon as possible to repair it.
The product warranty says that you provide spare parts and materials for free, but charge for the engineer’s labor.
This sounds unfair.
I believe the machine’s failure is caused by a manufacturing defect.
Initially, it made a lot of noise, and later, it stopped to operate entirely.
As it is wholly the company’s responsibility to correct the defect, I hope you will not make us pay for the labor component of its repair.

As we all know, it is not always easy to get work done at the office.
There is (A) frequently  rarely quiet time during regular business hours to sit and concentrate.
Office workers are regularly interrupted by ringing phones, impromptu meetings, and chattering coworkers.
This can be as frustrating for an employee as it is for the employer who is paying for this nonproductive work time.
Working at home can free you from these (B) attractions  distractions , giving you long blocks of time to focus on your work.
Although your home may present its own problems, too, there are ways to deal with them.
Your productivity will certainly (C) decrease  increase , as will the quality of your work product.
At the same time, you will get to enjoy the personal satisfaction of focusing on your work and getting it done.
