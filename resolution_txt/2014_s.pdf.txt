In our efforts to be the good child, the uncomplaining employee, or the cooperative patient, many of us fall into the trap of trying to please people by going along with whatever they want us to do.
 At times, we lose track of our own boundaries and needs, and the cost of this could be our life, both symbolically and literally.
 When we are unable to set healthy limits, it causes distress in our relationships.
 But when we learn to say no to what we dont feel like doing in order to say yes to our true self, we feel empowered, and our relationships with others improve.
 So dont be afraid to say no.
 Try to catch yourself in the moment and use your true voice to say what you really want to say.

 Some people punish themselves when they are under time pressure.
 They delete all the games on their PC, they stop going for walks, and they dont spend time with their friends.
 They then have less pleasure in life and less balance  and their work performance actually declines.
 Break out of this pattern by paying more attention to relaxation and getting more involved in living when you are under pressure.
 Define clear time periods for this half an hour for a walk, ten minutes to play a game on your PC, and so on.
 Your mind will become more creative during the break, and you will become mentally fitter.
 Free time without feelings of guilt will give you the strength to do highquality work in the remaining time.
 Furthermore, a certain amount of recreation reduces the chances of developing stressrelated disorders.

Large animals are actually less dangerous to hikers than smaller ones.
 Common sense tells us that we should avoid tigers, bears, and other large threatening animals.
 But smaller animals are actually more threatening than bigger animals.
 To overcome disadvantages of their size, small animals have developed useful weapons such as poison to protect themselves in the wild.
 Each year, only a few people are attacked by tigers or bears, and most of these incidents are caused by the people themselves.
 However, more people are killed by bites from small poisonous snakes than by these large animals.
 Even more people lose their lives from allergic reactions to common bee stings.
 For these reasons, hikers should be careful about small dangerous creatures.

 I regret to say the machine is no longer working.
 As we agreed during the meeting, please send a service engineer as soon as possible to repair it.
 The product warranty says that you provide spare parts and materials for free, but charge for the engineers labor.
 This sounds unfair.
 I believe the machines failure is caused by a manufacturing defect.
 Initially, it made a lot of noise, and later, it stopped to operate entirely.
 As it is wholly the companys responsibility to correct the defect, I hope you will not make us pay for the labor component of its repair.

It is well known that some baseball parks are better for hitting home runs than others.
 It is not just the size of the park that matters.
 Other park conditions such as wind and humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences, and players know this.
 So what happens when a player is moved to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home runs than his current one  say,  percent better.
 One analysis found that the player hit  percent more home runs.
 Why.
 The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal is.
 If you think you are likely to hit more home runs, you are more likely to swing for the fences.
 But if you think your chance of hitting a home run is smaller, your brain will send you signals to just try for a single to get on base.
In business and life, just as in baseball, our  can affect whether we swing for the fences or not.
 The baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that distance to be.
 Consider your work and your current life.
 Do the fences seem too far away to hit a home run.
 Simply adjust the fences so that it seems easier.

AMom once said that my grandmother came to America as a poor uneducated Greek immigrant at eighteen.
 My grandmother wanted to go to school, but the harsh immigrant life pushed a her to support her family.
 Though she never learned to read in school, she knew many traditional stories from her home country.
 BOne day, when I saw my grandmother on the street by chance, I noticed that b she had difficulty in reading an English sign.
 Right at that moment, it hit upon me to teach her to read English in return for all she had taught me.
 I talked to my mom about it, and c she was delighted with my plan.
 So my grandmother and I worked hard together using books for beginners.
CMy efforts were rewarded only a month later on the morning of my eighteenth birthday.
 My grandmother decorated a cake with HAPPY BIRTHDAY BETTY.
 I had only taught her the basics of reading, but d she had written these words all by herself.
 Touched by this simple message, I said, Its not just my birthday, Grandma.
 You stepped into this country at eighteen.
 Now, you are stepping into another new world.
 So its your birthday, too.
DMy grandmother liked to tell me these interesting stories at night.
 I still remember a few stories in which the gods made promises with each other like humans.
 Those who broke their promises were punished.
 While listening to the stories, I decided that I would not break any promises.
 The morals of e her stories taught me how I should live my life.

 Green, the charity president, was preparing this monthly event by herself.
 Lily complained, Mom, I dont feel like going today.
 Weve volunteered more than five times this year.
 She was eating slower than usual.
 I urged her, Lily, dont you remember we promised to help Ms.
 Green last month.
 Go and get dressed.
 I stood by the door and pointed at my watch.
 She slowly pulled on her sweater and said, I still dont feel like going.
 I started losing my patience.
 I responded, Dont you know Ms.
 Green has a lot of work to do for the picnic today.
 Its time you started thinking about other people.

It is well known that some baseball parks are better for hitting home runs than others.
 It is not just the size of the park that matters.
 Other park conditions such as wind and humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences, and players know this.
 So what happens when a player is moved to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home runs than his current one  say,  percent better.
 One analysis found that the player hit  percent more home runs.
 Why.
 The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal is.
 If you think you are likely to hit more home runs, you are more likely to swing for the fences.
 But if you think your chance of hitting a home run is smaller, your brain will send you signals to just try for a single to get on base.
In business and life, just as in baseball, our  can affect whether we swing for the fences or not.
 The baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that distance to be.
 Consider your work and your current life.
 Do the fences seem too far away to hit a home run.
 Simply adjust the fences so that it seems easier.

AMom once said that my grandmother came to America as a poor uneducated Greek immigrant at eighteen.

 BOne day, when I saw my grandmother on the street by chance, I noticed that b she had difficulty in reading an English sign.
 Right at that moment, it hit upon me to teach her to read English in return for all she had taught me.

Selfmonitoring refers to how much people try to control the way they present themselves to others.
 Those who have high selfmonitoring want their behavior to be socially acceptable.
 They adjust themselves to any social signal that indicates appropriate or inappropriate behavior.
 A, if they are in a meeting and see others making suggestions, they will try to make suggestions as well.
 They are also good at managing what others think about them.
 B, those who have low selfmonitoring are not very sensitive to signals indicating socially acceptable behavior.
 They are not too concerned about behaving the right way in a specific context.
 For example, if they are in a meeting with the president of an organization, they may act bored.

You have probably heard about sending messages across the sea in bottles.
 The problem is, it is impossible to tell how long it will take the sea to deliver its bottled messages or where it will wash them up.
A Columbus was still more than a thousand miles from Europe, and he feared he would never live to tell the king and queen of his discovery.
 So he wrote the news on a piece of paper.
B In , Christopher Columbus sent one of the earliest and most famous bottled messages.
 He was returning to Spain to tell the king and queen about what he had discovered, when his ship got caught in a bad storm.
C He put it in a wooden bottle and tossed it overboard.
 More than  years later, it was found by the captain of an American ship off the coast of Africa, near Morocco.

Life can be like riding a roller coaster.
 There are ups and downs, fast and slow parts, bumps and shaky parts, and even times when youre upside down.
 You cant control which way the track or in this case, life events will take you.
 When youre at the bottom, you can see only whats right in front of you, but when you get to the top, you can see the whole picture a lot better.
 When youre starting out, accept how you feel and try to enjoy the ride.
 When you design an amusement park for children, you should carefully consider the location of the roller coaster.
 When its over, youll see that it was really cool  even if you couldnt see that when you first started

 When Tom had helped the blind man to cross the street, he realized he had left his book bag on the bus stop bench.
As Tom was waiting for a bus, he noticed a blind man trying to cross the street.
   The traffic was heavy, and it was likely the blind man would get hit, as he was not crossing at a crosswalk.
   Tom looked around and saw there was no one else to help, so he asked the blind man if he would like help crossing the street.
   The blind man readily said yes, then latched onto Toms arm, and they began their walk across the street avoiding speeding cars.
   When Tom looked back at the bus stop bench, he saw another man sitting next to his book bag.
   And when Tom got to the bus stop bench, the man said, I saw what you were doing, so I decided to sit here and watch your book bag.
