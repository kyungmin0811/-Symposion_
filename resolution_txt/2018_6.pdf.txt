We thought hearing how you came up with your story would be meaningful to our readers.
We would thus like to ask if you could give a speech about your writing process.
This speech is expected to last for about an hour, and it will take place at Star Bookstore downtown.
You can choose a specific date and time depending on your schedule.
If you have any questions, please contact us by email at editorsnff.com.
We look forward to hearing how you wrote your story.
Sincerely, Susanna Martinez

Sipping coffee leisurely at a caf, Kate was enjoying the view of the Ponte Vecchio across the Arno.
As an architect and professor, she had taught about the historical significance of the bridge to her students for years.
A smile crept across her face.
It was her first time to actually see it in person.
Though not as old as the bridges of Rome, it was absolutely a work of art.
If the fleeing Nazis had destroyed it during World War II, she would have never seen it.
She was happy that she could view the bridge in the twilight.
Free from her daily concerns, her mind began to wander from the unforgettable views of the still Arno to all the unexpected but pleasant encounters with other tourists.
The trip was a rare liberating experience.
Kate felt that all her concerns had melted away.

Sure, we’ve all heard the advice “Follow your passion.” It’s great when you hit the jackpot and find a career that melds your strengths and passions, and where there is demand in the highly competitive global marketplace of today.
But if your goal is to get a job at the end of the rainbow, you must distinguish between your major, your passions, your strengths, and your career path.
Your strengths are more important than your passions.
Studies show that the best career choices tend to be grounded in things you’re good at, more so than your interests and passions.
Ideally, you want to find a convergence of your strengths and your values with a career path that is in demand.
Interests can come and go.
Your strengths are your core, your hardwired assets.

Parents are quick to inform friends and relatives as soon as their infant holds her head up, reaches for objects, sits by herself, and walks alone.
Parental enthusiasm for these motor accomplishments is not at all misplaced, for they are, indeed, milestones of development.
With each additional skill, babies gain control over their bodies and the environment in a new way.
Infants who are able to sit alone are granted an entirely different perspective on the world than are those who spend much of their day on their backs or stomachs.
Coordinated reaching opens up a whole new avenue for exploration of objects, and when babies can move about, their opportunities for independent exploration and manipulation are multiplied.
No longer are they restricted to their immediate locale and to objects that others place before them.
As new ways of controlling the environment are achieved, motor development provides the infant with a growing sense of competence and mastery, and it contributes in important ways to the infant’s perceptual and cognitive understanding of the world.

It is a strategic and tactical mistake to give an offensive position away to those who will use it to attack, criticize, and blame.
Since opponents will undoubtedly attack, criticize, and blame, anyway, the advantages of being proactive, airing one’s own “dirty laundry,” and “telling on oneself” are too significant to ignore.
Chief among these advantages is the ability to control the first messages and how a story is first framed.
That leaves others having to respond to you instead of the other way around.
This approach is appropriately termed “stealing thunder.” When an organization steals thunder, it breaks the news about its own crisis before the crisis is discovered by the media or other interested parties.
In experimental research by Arpan and RoskosEwoldsen, stealing thunder in a crisis situation, as opposed to allowing the information to be first disclosed by another party, resulted in substantially higher credibility ratings.
As significant, the authors found that “credibility ratings associated with stealing thunder directly predicted perceptions of the crisis as less severe.”  dirty laundry ,

If you’ve ever seen the bank of flashing screens at a broker’s desk, you have a sense of the information overload they are up against.
When deciding whether to invest in a company, for example, they may take into account the people at the helm; the current and potential size of its market; net profits; and its past, present, and future stock value, among other pieces of information.
Weighing all of these factors can take up so much of your working memory that it becomes overwhelmed.
Think of having piles and piles of papers, sticky notes, and spreadsheets strewn about your desk, and you get a picture of what’s going on inside the brain.
When information overloads working memory this way, it can make brokers ― and the rest of us ― scrap all the strategizing and analyses and go for emotional, or gut, decisions.

Though most bees fill their days visiting flowers and collecting pollen, some bees take advantage of the hard work of others.
These thieving bees sneak into the nest of an unsuspecting “normal” bee (known as the host), lay an egg near the pollen mass being gathered by the host bee for her own offspring, and then sneak back out.
When the egg of the thief hatches, it kills the host’s offspring and then eats the pollen meant for its victim.
Sometimes called brood parasites, these bees are also referred to as cuckoo bees, because they are similar to cuckoo birds, which lay an egg in the nest of another bird and leaves it for that bird to raise.
They are more technically called cleptoparasites.
Clepto means “thief” in Greek, and the term cleptoparasite refers specifically to an organism that lives off another by stealing its food.
In this case the cleptoparasite feeds on the host’s hardearned pollen stores.

Some coaches erroneously believe that mental skills training (MST) can only help perfect the performance of highly skilled competitors.
As a result, they shy away from MST, (A) denying  rationalizing that because they are not coaching elite athletes, mental skills training is less important.
It is true that mental skills become increasingly important at high levels of competition.
As athletes move up the competitive ladder, they become more homogeneous in terms of physical skills.
In fact, at high levels of competition, all athletes have the physical skills to be successful.
Consequently, any small difference in (B) physical  mental factors can play a huge role in determining performance outcomes.
However, we can anticipate that personal growth and performance will progress faster in young, developing athletes who are given mental skills training than in athletes not exposed to MST.
In fact, the optimal time for introducing MST may be when athletes are first beginning their sport.
Introducing MST (C) early  later in athletes’ careers may lay the foundation that will help them develop to their full potential.

Interest in extremely long periods of time sets geology and astronomy apart from other sciences.
Geologists think in terms of billions of years for the age of Earth and its oldest rocks ― numbers that, like the national debt, are not easily comprehended.
Nevertheless, the are important for environmental geologists because they provide a way to measure human impacts on the natural world.
For example, we would like to know the rate of natural soil formation from solid rock to determine whether topsoil erosion from agriculture is too great.
Likewise, understanding how climate has changed over millions of years is vital to properly assess current global warming trends.
Clues to past environmental change are well preserved in many different kinds of rocks.

Since the concept of a teddy bear is very obviously not a genetically inherited trait, we can be confident that we are looking at a cultural trait.
However, it is a cultural trait that seems to be under the guidance of another, genuinely biological trait the cues that attract us to babies (high foreheads and small faces).
Cute, babylike features are inherently appealing, producing a nurturing response in most humans.
Teddy bears that had a more babylike appearance― however slight this may have been initially ― were thus more popular with customers.
Teddy bear manufacturers obviously noticed which bears were selling best and so made more of these and fewer of the less popular models, to maximize their profits.
As a result, using animal images for commercial purposes was faced with severe criticism from animal rights activists.
In this way, the selection pressure built up by the customers resulted in the evolution of a more babylike bear by the manufacturers.

.It takes time to develop and launch products.
Consequently, many companies know  months ahead of time that they will be launching a new product.
(A) This marketing technique is called demand creation.
It involves creating a buzz about a new potentially revolutionary nutrient or training technique through publishing articles andor books that stimulate the reader’s interest.
Once this is done, a new product is launched.(B) Over a series of issues, you begin to see more articles discussing this new nutrient and potential to enhance training andor performance.
Then, after  months, a new product is coincidentally launched that contains the ingredient that has been discussed in previous issues.
Books and supplement reviews have also been used as vehicles to promote the sale of fitness and nutrition products.(C) In order to create interest in the product, companies will often launch premarket advertising campaigns.
In the nutrition industry, articles are often written discussing a new nutrient under investigation.

.The net effect of this was that, although customers benefited, the banks lost out as their costs increased but the total number of customers stayed the same.In mature markets, breakthroughs that lead to a major change in competitive positions and to the growth of the market are rare.
( ) Because of this, competition becomes a zero sum game in which one organization can only win at the expense of others.
( ) However, where the degree of competition is particularly intense a zero sum game can quickly become a negative sum game, in that everyone in the market is faced with additional costs.
( ) As an example of this, when one of the major high street banks in Britain tried to gain a competitive advantage by opening on Saturday mornings, it attracted a number of new customers who found the traditional MondayFriday bank opening hours to be a constraint.
( ) However, faced with a loss of customers, the competition responded by opening on Saturdays as well.
( ) In essence, this proved to be a negative sum game.
.Human beings discovered this art thousands of years ago, and they have invented several devices to make it easier and faster.In fiber processing the word ‘spinning’ means two quite different things.
( ) One is the formation of individual fibers by squeezing a liquid through one or more small openings in a nozzle called a spinneret and letting it harden.
( ) Spiders and silkworms have been spinning fibers in this way for millions of years, but chemists and engineers learned the procedure from them only about a century ago.
( ) In the other kind of spinning ― sometimes called throwing to prevent confusion with the first kind ― two or more fibers are twisted together to form a thread.
( ) The ancient distaff and spindle are examples that were replaced by the spinning wheel in the Middle Ages.
( ) Later came the spinning jenny, the water frame, and Crompton’s mule ― spinning machines that became symbols of the Industrial Revolution.

When considered in terms of evolutionary success, many of the seemingly irrational choices that people make do not seem so foolish after all.
Most animals, including our ancestors and modernday capuchin monkeys, lived very close to the margin of survival.
Paleontologists who study early human civilizations have uncovered evidence that our ancestors faced frequent periods of drought and freezing.
When you are living on the verge of starvation, a slight downturn in your food reserves makes a lot more difference than a slight upturn.
Anthropologists who study people still living in huntergatherer societies have discovered that they regularly make choices designed to produce not the best opportunity for obtaining a hyperabundant supply of food but, instead, the least danger of ending up with an insufficient supply.
In other words, people everywhere have a strong motivation to avoid falling below the level that will feed themselves and their families.
If our ancestors hadn’t agonized over losses and instead had taken too many chances in going after the big gains, they’d have been more likely to lose out and never become anyone’s ancestor.
agonize , Our ancestors gave priority to(A)minimum resources rather than pursuing maximum gains, and that was the rational choice for human(B) from an evolutionary perspective.

According to many sociologists, the study of what our society calls ‘art’ can only really progress if we drop the highly specific and ideologically loaded terminology of ‘art’, ‘artworks’ and ‘artists’, and replace these with the more neutral and less historically specific terms ‘cultural forms’, ‘cultural products’ and ‘cultural producers’.
These cultural products ― be they paintings, sculptures, forms of music or whatever ― should be regarded as being made by certain types of cultural producer, and as being used by particular groups of people in particular ways in specific social contexts.
By using the more neutral term ‘cultural products’ for particular objects, and ‘cultural producers’ for the people who make those objects, the sociologist seeks to break with a view that shehe sees as having dominated the study of cultural forms for too long, namely trying to understand everything in terms of the category ‘art’.
This is a category that is too limited and contextspecific to encompass all the different cultural products that people in different societies make and use.
It is a term that is also too loaded to take at face value and to use naively in study of our own society.
Since it is in the interests of certain social groups to define some things as ‘art’ and others as not, the very term ‘art’ itself cannot be uncritically used by the sociologist who wishes to understand how and why such labelling processes occur.
Quite simply, then, in order to study cultural matters, many sociologists believe one has to  the terms ‘art’, ‘artwork’ and ‘artist’ as the basis for our analysis.
Instead, these terms become important objects of analysis themselves.

(A)Andrew steadied his eyes upon the black and white squares.
He thought awhile before pushing his knight to an unbeatable position.
Now Andrew was sure he had beaten Timothy Tandon, the winner of the  National Chess Championship.
Andrew, whom nobody had noticed before the tournament this year, came to progress to the final match.
After enjoying this memorable victory, Andrew headed straight to the nursing home where (a) his sick grandad was staying.(B)It was the day of the final match.
That morning Andrew had received a call from the nursing home informing him that Grandad’s condition had become serious.
The news played upon Andrew’s mind as (b) he started to play.
After several fierce battles, Andrew’s concentration wavered for a moment.
His mind travelled to his grandad, who was in another battle for his life.
It was then that Andrew made a big mistake The mistake was a fatal one, and it was all over.
(c) He had lost.(C)Andrew arrived at the nursing home in a gloomy mood, but he was blessed with good news.
His grandad was recovering.
Andrew was greatly delighted, but (d) he could not help being disappointed in a corner of his mind.
“I tried my best to fulfill your dream but I couldn’t make it,” Andrew said in disappointment.
“That’s all right,” said Grandad.
“The real lesson of chess is learning how to tame your mind.
See, my mind has won the battle over my body.
I will recover soon and see you become champion one day in perfect health.” Andrew was relieved and smiled with joy.(D)When Andrew reached the nursing home, Grandad was sitting up in bed.
“You won the semifinal” (e) he asked, offering up a weak smile.
Andrew nodded his head.
Indeed, Andrew’s grandad was his chess master.
As a kid, Andrew liked to observe Grandad play chess and often predicted his moves even before he began to move the pieces.
“Andrew,” said Grandad, inspired by his grandson’s superb victory, “you are now all set to fulfill my dream.
Tomorrow you will surely win the National Chess Championship.”
