19. 다음 글에 드러난 David의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
David was starting a new job in Vancouver, and he was 
waiting for his bus. He kept looking back and forth between 
his watch and the direction the bus would come from. He 
thought, “My bus isn’t here yet. I can’t be late on my first 
day.” David couldn’t feel at ease. When he looked up again, 
he saw a different bus coming that was going right to his 
work. The bus stopped in front of him and opened its door. He 
got on the bus thinking, “Phew! Luckily, this bus came just in 
time so I won’t be late.” He leaned back on an unoccupied seat 
in the bus and took a deep breath, finally able to relax.

20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Values alone do not create and build culture. Living your 
values only some of the time does not contribute to the 
creation and maintenance of culture. Changing values into 
behaviors is only half the battle. Certainly, this is a step in the 
right direction, but those behaviors must then be shared and 
distributed widely throughout the organization, along with a 
clear and concise description of what is expected. It is not 
enough to simply talk about it. It is critical to have a visual 
representation of the specific behaviors that leaders and all 
people managers can use to coach their people. Just like a 
sports team has a playbook with specific plays designed to 
help them perform well and win, your company should have a 
playbook with the key shifts needed to transform your culture 
into action and turn your values into winning behaviors.

21. 밑줄 친 a nonstick frying pan이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 
가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
How you focus your attention plays a critical role in how 
you deal with stress. Scattered attention harms your ability to let 
go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, 
it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the 
stressful parts of your experience. When your attentional 
spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress. You 
can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and 
not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial 
and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus 
heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened 
focus turns down the stress level because you’re better able to put 
each situation into a broader perspective. One anxiety-provoking 
detail is less important than the bigger picture. It’s like 
transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan. You can still 
fry an egg, but the egg won’t stick to the pan.
* provoke: 유발시키다
①never being confronted with any stressful experiences in daily life
②broadening one’s perspective to identify the cause of stress
③rarely confining one’s attention to positive aspects of an experience 
④having a larger view of an experience beyond its stressful aspects
⑤taking stress into account as the source of developing a wide view
22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Being able to prioritize your responses allows you to connect 
more deeply with individual customers, be it a one-off interaction 
around a particularly delightful or upsetting experience, or the 
development of a longer-term relationship with a significantly 
influential individual within your customer base. If you’ve 
ever posted a favorable comment ― or any comment, for that 
matter ― about a brand, product or service, think about what it 
would feel like if you were personally acknowledged by the 
brand manager, for example, as a result. In general, people 
post because they have something to say ― and because they 
want to be recognized for having said it. In particular, when 
people post positive comments they are expressions of 
appreciation for the experience that led to the post. While a 
compliment to the person standing next to you is typically 
answered with a response like “Thank You,” the sad fact is 
that most brand compliments go unanswered. These are lost 
opportunities to understand what drove the compliments and 
create a solid fan based on them.

23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Managers of natural resources typically face market 
incentives that provide financial rewards for exploitation. For 
example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut 
down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, 
wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services. 
These services provide the owner with no financial benefits, 
and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions. But 
the economic benefits provided by these services, based on 
their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the 
timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated 
that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by 
tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification, 
and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare 
than the market benefits. Thus cutting down the trees is 
economically inefficient, and markets are not sending the correct 
“signal” to favor ecosystem services over extractive uses.
* exploitation: 이용
** timber: 목재
①necessity of calculating the market values of ecosystem services
②significance of weighing forest resources’ non-market values
③impact of using forest resources to maximize financial benefits
④merits of balancing forests’ market and non-market values
⑤ways of increasing the efficiency of managing natural resources
24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
The concept of overtourism rests on a particular assumption 
about people and places common in tourism studies and the 
social sciences in general. Both are seen as clearly defined and 
demarcated. People are framed as bounded social actors either 
playing the role of hosts or guests. Places, in a similar way, are 
treated as stable containers with clear boundaries. Hence, 
places can be full of tourists and thus suffer from overtourism. 
But what does it mean for a place to be full of people? Indeed, 
there are examples of particular attractions that have limited 
capacity and where there is actually no room for more visitors. 
This is not least the case with some man-made constructions 
such as the Eiffel Tower. However, with places such as cities, 
regions or even whole countries being promoted as destinations 
and described as victims of overtourism, things become more 
complex. What is excessive or out of proportion is highly 
relative and might be more related to other aspects than physical 
capacity, such as natural degradation and economic leakages 
(not to mention politics and local power dynamics).
* demarcate: 경계를 정하다
①The Solutions to Overtourism: From Complex to Simple
②What Makes Popular Destinations Attractive to Visitors?
③Are Tourist Attractions Winners or Losers of Overtourism?
④The Severity of Overtourism: Much Worse than Imagined
⑤Overtourism: Not Simply a Matter of People and Places

The above graph shows the percentages of the respondents 
in five countries who sometimes or often actively avoided 
news in 2017, 2019, and 2022. ①For each of the three years, 
Ireland showed the highest percentage of the respondents who 
sometimes or often actively avoided news, among the countries 
in the graph. ②In Germany, the percentage of the respondents 
who sometimes or often actively avoided news was less than 
30% in each of the three years. ③In Denmark, the percentage 
of the respondents who sometimes or often actively avoided 
news in 2019 was higher than that in 2017 but lower than that 
in 2022. ④In Finland, the percentage of the respondents who 
sometimes or often actively avoided news in 2019 was lower 
than that in 2017, which was also true for Japan. ⑤In Japan, 
the percentage of the respondents who sometimes or often 
actively avoided news did not exceed 15% in each of the three 
years.
26. Charles H. Townes에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Charles H. Townes, one of the most influential American 
physicists, was born in South Carolina. In his childhood, he 
grew up on a farm, studying the stars in the sky. He earned his 
doctoral degree from the California Institute of Technology in 
1939, and then he took a job at Bell Labs in New York City. 
After World War II, he became an associate professor of physics 
at Columbia University. In 1958, Townes and his co-researcher 
proposed the concept of the laser. Laser technology won quick 
acceptance in industry and research. He received the Nobel 
Prize in Physics in 1964. He was also involved in Project 
Apollo, the moon landing project. His contribution is priceless 
because the Internet and all digital media would be 
unimaginable without the laser.
①어린 시절에 농장에서 성장하였다.
②박사 학위를 받기 전에 Bell Labs에서 일했다.
③1958년에 레이저의 개념을 제안하였다.
④1964년에 노벨 물리학상을 수상하였다.
⑤달 착륙 프로젝트에 관여하였다.

29. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
A number of studies provide substantial evidence of an 
innate human disposition to respond differentially to social 
stimuli. From birth, infants will orient preferentially towards 
the human face and voice, ①seeming to know that such 
stimuli are particularly meaningful for them. Moreover, they 
register this connection actively, imitating a variety of facial 
gestures that are presented to them ― tongue protrusions, lip 
tightenings, mouth openings. They will even try to match 
gestures ②which they have some difficulty, experimenting with 
their own faces until they succeed. When they ③do succeed, 
they show pleasure by a brightening of their eyes; when they 
fail, they show distress. In other words, they not only have 
an innate capacity for matching their own kinaesthetically 
experienced bodily movements with ④those of others that are 
visually perceived; they have an innate drive to do so. That is, 
they seem to have an innate drive to imitate others whom they 
judge ⑤to be ‘like me’.
* innate: 타고난
** disposition: 성향
*** kinaesthetically: 운동감각적으로

Bazaar economies feature an apparently flexible price-setting 
mechanism that sits atop more enduring ties of shared culture. 
Both the buyer and seller are aware of each other’s ①restrictions. 
In Delhi’s bazaars, buyers and sellers can ②assess to a large 
extent the financial constraints that other actors have in their 
everyday life. Each actor belonging to a specific economic class 
understands what the other sees as a necessity and a luxury. 
In the case of electronic products like video games, they are not 
a ③necessity at the same level as other household purchases 
such as food items. So, the seller in Delhi’s bazaars is careful 
not to directly ask for very ④low prices for video games 
because at no point will the buyer see possession of them as an 
absolute necessity. Access to this type of knowledge establishes 
a price consensus by relating to each other’s preferences and 
limitations of belonging to a ⑤similar cultural and economic 
universe.
* constraint: 압박
** consensus: 일치

31. Over the last decade the attention given to how children 
learn to read has foregrounded the nature of textuality, and of 
the different, interrelated ways in which readers of all ages 
make texts mean. ‘Reading’ now applies to a greater number of 
representational forms than at any time in the past: pictures, 
maps, screens, design graphics and photographs are all 
regarded as text. In addition to the innovations made possible 
in picture books by new printing processes, design features 
also predominate in other kinds, such as books of poetry and 
information texts. Thus, reading becomes a more complicated 
kind of interpretation than it was when children’s attention 
was focused on the printed text, with sketches or pictures as an 
adjunct. Children now learn from a picture book that words 
and illustrations complement and enhance each other. Reading 
is not simply 
. Even in the easiest 
texts, what a sentence ‘says’ is often not what it means.
* adjunct: 부속물
①knowledge acquisition
②word recognition
③imaginative play 
④subjective interpretation
⑤image mapping
32. A musical score within any film can add an additional layer 
to the film text, which goes beyond simply imitating the action 
viewed. In films that tell of futuristic worlds, composers, much 
like sound designers, have added freedom to create a world that 
is unknown and new to the viewer. However, unlike sound 
designers, composers often shy away from creating unique 
pieces that reflect these new worlds and often present musical 
scores that possess familiar structures and cadences. While it is 
possible that this may interfere with creativity and a sense of 
space and time, it in fact 
. 
Through recognizable scores, visions of the future or a galaxy 
far, far away can be placed within a recognizable context. 
Such familiarity allows the viewer to be placed in a comfortable 
space so that the film may then lead the viewer to what is an 
unfamiliar, but acceptable vision of a world different from their 
own.
* score: 악보
** cadence: (율동적인) 박자
①frees the plot of its familiarity
②aids in viewer access to the film
③adds to an exotic musical experience
④orients audiences to the film’s theme
⑤inspires viewers to think more deeply

33. There have been psychological studies in which subjects 
were shown photographs of people’s faces and asked to 
identify the expression or state of mind evinced. The results 
are invariably very mixed. In the 17th century the French 
painter and theorist Charles Le Brun drew a series of faces 
illustrating the various emotions that painters could be called 
upon to represent. What is striking about them is that 
. What 
is missing in all this is any setting or context to make the 
emotion determinate. We must know who this person is, who 
these other people are, what their relationship is, what is at 
stake in the scene, and the like. In real life as well as in 
painting we do not come across just faces; we encounter 
people in particular situations and our understanding of people 
cannot somehow be precipitated and held isolated from the 
social and human circumstances in which they, and we, live 
and breathe and have our being. [3점]
* evince: (감정 따위를) 분명히 나타내다
** precipitate: 촉발하다
①all of them could be matched consistently with their intended emotions
②every one of them was illustrated with photographic precision
③each of them definitively displayed its own social narrative
④most of them would be seen as representing unique characteristics
⑤any number of them could be substituted for one another without loss
34. Everyone who drives, walks, or swipes a transit card in a 
city views herself as a transportation expert from the moment 
she walks out the front door. And how she views the street 
. That’s 
why we find so many well-intentioned and civic-minded 
citizens arguing past one another. At neighborhood meetings 
in school auditoriums, and in back rooms at libraries and 
churches, local residents across the nation gather for 
often-contentious discussions about transportation proposals 
that would change a city’s streets. And like all politics, all 
transportation is local and intensely personal. A transit project 
that could speed travel for tens of thousands of people can be 
stopped by objections to the loss of a few parking spaces or by 
the simple fear that the project won’t work. It’s not a challenge 
of the data or the traffic engineering or the planning. Public 
debates about streets are typically rooted in emotional 
assumptions about how a change will affect a person’s 
commute, ability to park, belief about what is safe and what 
isn’t, or the bottom line of a local business. [3점]
* swipe: 판독기에 통과시키다
** contentious: 논쟁적인
*** commute: 통근
①relies heavily on how others see her city’s streets
②updates itself with each new public transit policy
③arises independently of the streets she travels on
④tracks pretty closely with how she gets around
⑤ties firmly in with how her city operates
35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Speaking fast is a high-risk proposition. It’s nearly impossible 
to maintain the ideal conditions to be persuasive, well-spoken, 
and effective when the mouth is traveling well over the speed 
limit. ①Although we’d like to think that our minds are sharp 
enough to always make good decisions with the greatest 
efficiency, they just aren’t. ②In reality, the brain arrives at an 
intersection of four or five possible things to say and sits idling 
for a couple of seconds, considering the options. ③Making a 
good decision helps you speak faster because it provides you 
with more time to come up with your responses. ④When the 
brain stops sending navigational instructions back to the 
mouth and the mouth is moving too fast to pause, that’s when

Negotiation can be defined as an attempt to explore and 
reconcile conflicting positions in order to reach an 
acceptable outcome.
(A) Areas of difference can and do frequently remain, and 
will perhaps be the subject of future negotiations, or 
indeed remain irreconcilable. In those instances in which 
the parties have highly antagonistic or polarised relations, 
the process is likely to be dominated by the exposition, 
very often in public, of the areas of conflict.
(B) In these and sometimes other forms of negotiation, 
negotiation serves functions other than reconciling 
conflicting interests. These will include delay, publicity, 
diverting attention or seeking intelligence about the other 
party and its negotiating position.
(C) Whatever the nature of the outcome, which may actually 
favour one party more than another, the purpose of 
negotiation is the identification of areas of common interest 
and conflict. In this sense, depending on the intentions of 
the parties, the areas of common interest may be clarified, 
refined and given negotiated form and substance.

Norms emerge in groups as a result of people conforming 
to the behavior of others. Thus, the start of a norm occurs 
when one person acts in a particular manner in a particular 
situation because she thinks she ought to.
(A) Thus, she may prescribe the behavior to them by uttering 
the norm statement in a prescriptive manner. Alternately, 
she may communicate that conformity is desired in other 
ways, such as by gesturing. In addition, she may threaten 
to sanction them for not behaving as she wishes. This will 
cause some to conform to her wishes and act as she acts.
(B) But some others will not need to have the behavior prescribed 
to them. They will observe the regularity of behavior and 
decide on their own that they ought to conform. They may do 
so for either rational or moral reasons.
(C) Others may then conform to this behavior for a number of 
reasons. The person who performed the initial action may 
think that others ought to behave as she behaves in 
situations of this sort. [3점]

Yes, some contests are seen as world class, such as 
identification of the Higgs particle or the development of 
high temperature superconductors.
Science is sometimes described as a winner-take-all contest, 
meaning that there are no rewards for being second or third. 
This is an extreme view of the nature of scientific contests. 
( ①) Even those who describe scientific contests in such a 
way note that it is a somewhat inaccurate description, given 
that replication and verification have social value and are 
common in science. ( ②) It is also inaccurate to the extent 
that it suggests that only a handful of contests exist. ( ③) But 
many other contests have multiple parts, and the number of 
such contests may be increasing. ( ④) By way of example, 
for many years it was thought that there would be “one” cure 
for cancer, but it is now realized that cancer takes multiple 
forms and that multiple approaches are needed to provide a 
cure. ( ⑤) There won’t be one winner ― there will be many.

At the next step in the argument, however, the analogy 
breaks down.
Misprints in a book or in any written message usually have a 
negative impact on the content, sometimes (literally) fatally. 
( ①) The displacement of a comma, for instance, may be a 
matter of life and death. ( ②) Similarly most mutations have 
harmful consequences for the organism in which they occur, 
meaning that they reduce its reproductive fitness. ( ③) 
Occasionally, however, a mutation may occur that increases 
the fitness of the organism, just as an accidental failure to 
reproduce the text of the first edition might provide more 
accurate or updated information. ( ④) A favorable mutation 
is going to be more heavily represented in the next generation, 
since the organism in which it occurred will have more offspring 
and mutations are transmitted to the offspring. ( ⑤) By 
contrast, there is no mechanism by which a book that 
accidentally corrects the mistakes of the first edition will tend 
to sell better. [3점]

Even those with average talent can produce notable work 
in the various sciences, so long as they do not try to embrace 
all of them at once. Instead, they should concentrate attention 
on one subject after another (that is, in different periods of 
time), although later work will weaken earlier attainments 
in the other spheres. This amounts to saying that the brain 
adapts to universal science in time but not in space. In fact, 
even those with great abilities proceed in this way. Thus, 
when we are astonished by someone with publications in 
different scientific fields, realize that each topic was 
explored during a specific period of time. Knowledge 
gained earlier certainly will not have disappeared from the 
mind of the author, but it will have become simplified by 
condensing into formulas or greatly abbreviated symbols. 
Thus, sufficient space remains for the perception and 
learning of new images on the cerebral blackboard.

One way to avoid contributing to overhyping a story would 
be to say nothing. However, that is not a realistic option for 
scientists who feel a strong sense of responsibility to inform 
the public and policymakers and/or to offer suggestions. 
Speaking with members of the media has (a) advantages in 
getting a message out and perhaps receiving favorable 
recognition, but it runs the risk of misinterpretations, the need 
for repeated clarifications, and entanglement in never-ending 
controversy. Hence, the decision of whether to speak with the 
media tends to be highly individualized. Decades ago, it 
was (b) unusual for Earth scientists to have results that were 
of interest to the media, and consequently few media contacts 
were expected or encouraged. In the 1970s, the few scientists 
who spoke frequently with the media were often (c) criticized 
by their fellow scientists for having done so. The situation 
now is quite different, as many scientists feel a responsibility 
to speak out because of the importance of global warming and 
related issues, and many reporters share these feelings. In 
addition, many scientists are finding that they (d) enjoy the 
media attention and the public recognition that comes with it. 
At the same time, other scientists continue to resist speaking 
with reporters, thereby preserving more time for their science 
and (e) running the risk of being misquoted and the other 
unpleasantries associated with media coverage.

Emma and Clara stood side by side on the beach road, with 
their eyes fixed on the boundless ocean. The breathtaking 
scene that surrounded them was beyond description. Just after 
sunrise, they finished their preparations for the bicycle ride 
along the beach road. Emma turned to Clara with a question, 
“Do you think this will be your favorite ride ever?” Clara’s 
face lit up with a bright smile as she nodded. “Definitely! 
(a) I can’t wait to ride while watching those beautiful waves!”
(B)
When they reached their destination, Emma and Clara 
stopped their bikes. Emma approached Clara, saying “Bicycle 
riding is unlike swimming, isn’t it?” Clara answered with a 
smile, “Quite similar, actually. Just like swimming, riding 
makes me feel truly alive.” She added, “It shows (b) me what 
it means to live while facing life’s tough challenges.” Emma 
nodded in agreement and suggested, “Your first beach bike 
ride was a great success. How about coming back next summer?” 
Clara replied with delight, “With (c) you, absolutely!”
(C)
Clara used to be a talented swimmer, but she had to give up 
her dream of becoming an Olympic medalist in swimming 
because of shoulder injuries. Yet she responded to the hardship 
in a constructive way. After years of hard training, she made 
an incredible recovery and found a new passion for bike 
riding. Emma saw how the painful past made her maturer and 
how it made (d) her stronger in the end. One hour later, Clara, 
riding ahead of Emma, turned back and shouted, “Look at the 
white cliff!”
(D)
Emma and Clara jumped on their bikes and started to pedal 
toward the white cliff where the beach road ended. Speeding 
up and enjoying the wide blue sea, Emma couldn’t hide her 
excitement and exclaimed, “Clara, the view is amazing!” 
Clara’s silence, however, seemed to say that she was lost in her 
thoughts. Emma understood the meaning of her silence. 
Watching Clara riding beside her, Emma thought about Clara’s 
past tragedy, which (e) she now seemed to have overcome.

David was starting a new job in Vancouver, and he was 
waiting for his bus. He kept looking back and forth between 
his watch and the direction the bus would come from. He 
thought, “My bus isn’t here yet. I can’t be late on my first 
day.” David couldn’t feel at ease. When he looked up again, 
he saw a different bus coming that was going right to his 
work. The bus stopped in front of him and opened its door. He 
got on the bus thinking, “Phew! Luckily, this bus came just in 
time so I won’t be late.” He leaned back on an unoccupied seat 
in the bus and took a deep breath, finally able to relax.

Values alone do not create and build culture. Living your 
values only some of the time does not contribute to the 
creation and maintenance of culture. Changing values into 
behaviors is only half the battle. Certainly, this is a step in the 
right direction, but those behaviors must then be shared and 
distributed widely throughout the organization, along with a 
clear and concise description of what is expected. It is not 
enough to simply talk about it. It is critical to have a visual 
representation of the specific behaviors that leaders and all 
people managers can use to coach their people. Just like a 
sports team has a playbook with specific plays designed to 
help them perform well and win, your company should have a 
playbook with the key shifts needed to transform your culture 
into action and turn your values into winning behaviors.

가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
How you focus your attention plays a critical role in how 
you deal with stress. Scattered attention harms your ability to let 
go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, 
it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the 
stressful parts of your experience. When your attentional 
spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress. You 
can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and 
not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial 
and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus 
heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened 
focus turns down the stress level because you’re better able to put 
each situation into a broader perspective. One anxiety-provoking 
detail is less important than the bigger picture. It’s like 
transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan. You can still 
fry an egg, but the egg won’t stick to the pan.
* provoke: 유발시키다
①never being confronted with any stressful experiences in daily life
②broadening one’s perspective to identify the cause of stress
③rarely confining one’s attention to positive aspects of an experience 
④having a larger view of an experience beyond its stressful aspects
⑤taking stress into account as the source of developing a wide view

Being able to prioritize your responses allows you to connect 
more deeply with individual customers, be it a one-off interaction 
around a particularly delightful or upsetting experience, or the 
development of a longer-term relationship with a significantly 
influential individual within your customer base. If you’ve 
ever posted a favorable comment ― or any comment, for that 
matter ― about a brand, product or service, think about what it 
would feel like if you were personally acknowledged by the 
brand manager, for example, as a result. In general, people 
post because they have something to say ― and because they 
want to be recognized for having said it. In particular, when 
people post positive comments they are expressions of 
appreciation for the experience that led to the post. While a 
compliment to the person standing next to you is typically 
answered with a response like “Thank You,” the sad fact is 
that most brand compliments go unanswered. These are lost 
opportunities to understand what drove the compliments and 
create a solid fan based on them.

23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Managers of natural resources typically face market 
incentives that provide financial rewards for exploitation. For 
example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut 
down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, 
wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services. 
These services provide the owner with no financial benefits, 
and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions. But 
the economic benefits provided by these services, based on 
their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the 
timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated 
that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by 
tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification, 
and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare 
than the market benefits. Thus cutting down the trees is 
economically inefficient, and markets are not sending the correct 
“signal” to favor ecosystem services over extractive uses.
* exploitation: 이용
** timber: 목재
①necessity of calculating the market values of ecosystem services
②impact of using forest resources to maximize financial benefits
③ways of increasing the efficiency of managing natural resources
④significance of weighing forest resources’ non-market values
⑤merits of balancing forests’ market and non-market values

The concept of overtourism rests on a particular assumption 
about people and places common in tourism studies and the 
social sciences in general. Both are seen as clearly defined and 
demarcated. People are framed as bounded social actors either 
playing the role of hosts or guests. Places, in a similar way, are 
treated as stable containers with clear boundaries. Hence, 
places can be full of tourists and thus suffer from overtourism. 
But what does it mean for a place to be full of people? Indeed, 
there are examples of particular attractions that have limited 
capacity and where there is actually no room for more visitors. 
This is not least the case with some man-made constructions 
such as the Eiffel Tower. However, with places such as cities, 
regions or even whole countries being promoted as destinations 
and described as victims of overtourism, things become more 
complex. What is excessive or out of proportion is highly 
relative and might be more related to other aspects than physical 
capacity, such as natural degradation and economic leakages 
(not to mention politics and local power dynamics).
* demarcate: 경계를 정하다

The above graph shows the percentages of the respondents 
in five countries who sometimes or often actively avoided 
news in 2017, 2019, and 2022. ①For each of the three years, 
Ireland showed the highest percentage of the respondents who 
sometimes or often actively avoided news, among the countries 
in the graph. ②In Germany, the percentage of the respondents 
who sometimes or often actively avoided news was less than 
30% in each of the three years. ③In Denmark, the percentage 
of the respondents who sometimes or often actively avoided 
news in 2019 was higher than that in 2017 but lower than that 
in 2022. ④In Finland, the percentage of the respondents who 
sometimes or often actively avoided news in 2019 was lower 
than that in 2017, which was also true for Japan. ⑤In Japan, 
the percentage of the respondents who sometimes or often 
actively avoided news did not exceed 15% in each of the three 
years.
26. Charles H. Townes에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는

Charles H. Townes, one of the most influential American 
physicists, was born in South Carolina. In his childhood, he 
grew up on a farm, studying the stars in the sky. He earned his 
doctoral degree from the California Institute of Technology in 
1939, and then he took a job at Bell Labs in New York City. 
After World War II, he became an associate professor of physics 
at Columbia University. In 1958, Townes and his co-researcher 
proposed the concept of the laser. Laser technology won quick 
acceptance in industry and research. He received the Nobel 
Prize in Physics in 1964. He was also involved in Project 
Apollo, the moon landing project. His contribution is priceless 
because the Internet and all digital media would be 
unimaginable without the laser.
①어린 시절에 농장에서 성장하였다.
②박사 학위를 받기 전에 Bell Labs에서 일했다.

A number of studies provide substantial evidence of an 
innate human disposition to respond differentially to social 
stimuli. From birth, infants will orient preferentially towards 
the human face and voice, ①seeming to know that such 
stimuli are particularly meaningful for them. Moreover, they 
register this connection actively, imitating a variety of facial 
gestures that are presented to them ― tongue protrusions, lip 
tightenings, mouth openings. They will even try to match 
gestures ②which they have some difficulty, experimenting with 
their own faces until they succeed. When they ③do succeed, 
they show pleasure by a brightening of their eyes; when they 
fail, they show distress. In other words, they not only have 
an innate capacity for matching their own kinaesthetically 
experienced bodily movements with ④those of others that are 
visually perceived; they have an innate drive to do so. That is, 
they seem to have an innate drive to imitate others whom they 
judge ⑤to be ‘like me’.

Bazaar economies feature an apparently flexible price-setting 
mechanism that sits atop more enduring ties of shared culture. 
Both the buyer and seller are aware of each other’s ①restrictions. 
In Delhi’s bazaars, buyers and sellers can ②assess to a large 
extent the financial constraints that other actors have in their 
everyday life. Each actor belonging to a specific economic class 
understands what the other sees as a necessity and a luxury. 
In the case of electronic products like video games, they are not 
a ③necessity at the same level as other household purchases 
such as food items. So, the seller in Delhi’s bazaars is careful 
not to directly ask for very ④low prices for video games 
because at no point will the buyer see possession of them as an 
absolute necessity. Access to this type of knowledge establishes 
a price consensus by relating to each other’s preferences and 
limitations of belonging to a ⑤similar cultural and economic 
universe.
* constraint: 압박

31. Over the last decade the attention given to how children 
learn to read has foregrounded the nature of textuality, and of 
the different, interrelated ways in which readers of all ages 
make texts mean. ‘Reading’ now applies to a greater number of 
representational forms than at any time in the past: pictures, 
maps, screens, design graphics and photographs are all 
regarded as text. In addition to the innovations made possible 
in picture books by new printing processes, design features 
also predominate in other kinds, such as books of poetry and 
information texts. Thus, reading becomes a more complicated 
kind of interpretation than it was when children’s attention 
was focused on the printed text, with sketches or pictures as an 
adjunct. Children now learn from a picture book that words 
and illustrations complement and enhance each other. Reading 
is not simply 
. Even in the easiest 
texts, what a sentence ‘says’ is often not what it means.
* adjunct: 부속물
①word recognition
②imaginative play
③knowledge acquisition
④image mapping
⑤subjective interpretation
32. A musical score within any film can add an additional layer 
to the film text, which goes beyond simply imitating the action 
viewed. In films that tell of futuristic worlds, composers, much 
like sound designers, have added freedom to create a world that 
is unknown and new to the viewer. However, unlike sound 
designers, composers often shy away from creating unique 
pieces that reflect these new worlds and often present musical 
scores that possess familiar structures and cadences. While it is 
possible that this may interfere with creativity and a sense of 
space and time, it in fact 
. 
Through recognizable scores, visions of the future or a galaxy 
far, far away can be placed within a recognizable context. 
Such familiarity allows the viewer to be placed in a comfortable 
space so that the film may then lead the viewer to what is an 
unfamiliar, but acceptable vision of a world different from their 
own.
* score: 악보
** cadence: (율동적인) 박자
①frees the plot of its familiarity
②aids in viewer access to the film
③adds to an exotic musical experience
④orients audiences to the film’s theme
⑤inspires viewers to think more deeply

33. There have been psychological studies in which subjects 
were shown photographs of people’s faces and asked to 
identify the expression or state of mind evinced. The results 
are invariably very mixed. In the 17th century the French 
painter and theorist Charles Le Brun drew a series of faces 
illustrating the various emotions that painters could be called 
upon to represent. What is striking about them is that 
. What 
is missing in all this is any setting or context to make the 
emotion determinate. We must know who this person is, who 
these other people are, what their relationship is, what is at 
stake in the scene, and the like. In real life as well as in 
painting we do not come across just faces; we encounter 
people in particular situations and our understanding of people 
cannot somehow be precipitated and held isolated from the 
social and human circumstances in which they, and we, live 
and breathe and have our being. [3점]
* evince: (감정 따위를) 분명히 나타내다
** precipitate: 촉발하다
①all of them could be matched consistently with their intended emotions
②every one of them was illustrated with photographic precision
③each of them definitively displayed its own social narrative
④most of them would be seen as representing unique characteristics
⑤any number of them could be substituted for one another without loss
34. Everyone who drives, walks, or swipes a transit card in a 
city views herself as a transportation expert from the moment 
she walks out the front door. And how she views the street 
. That’s 
why we find so many well-intentioned and civic-minded 
citizens arguing past one another. At neighborhood meetings 
in school auditoriums, and in back rooms at libraries and 
churches, local residents across the nation gather for 
often-contentious discussions about transportation proposals 
that would change a city’s streets. And like all politics, all 
transportation is local and intensely personal. A transit project 
that could speed travel for tens of thousands of people can be 
stopped by objections to the loss of a few parking spaces or by 
the simple fear that the project won’t work. It’s not a challenge 
of the data or the traffic engineering or the planning. Public 
debates about streets are typically rooted in emotional 
assumptions about how a change will affect a person’s 
commute, ability to park, belief about what is safe and what 
isn’t, or the bottom line of a local business. [3점]
* swipe: 판독기에 통과시키다
** contentious: 논쟁적인

①relies heavily on how others see her city’s streets
②updates itself with each new public transit policy
③arises independently of the streets she travels on
④tracks pretty closely with how she gets around
⑤ties firmly in with how her city operates

Speaking fast is a high-risk proposition. It’s nearly impossible 
to maintain the ideal conditions to be persuasive, well-spoken, 
and effective when the mouth is traveling well over the speed 
limit. ①Although we’d like to think that our minds are sharp 
enough to always make good decisions with the greatest 
efficiency, they just aren’t. ②In reality, the brain arrives at an 
intersection of four or five possible things to say and sits idling 
for a couple of seconds, considering the options. ③Making a 
good decision helps you speak faster because it provides you 
with more time to come up with your responses. ④When the 
brain stops sending navigational instructions back to the 
mouth and the mouth is moving too fast to pause, that’s when 
you get a verbal fender bender, otherwise known as filler. 
⑤Um, ah, you know, and like are what your mouth does when 
it has nowhere to go.

Negotiation can be defined as an attempt to explore and 
reconcile conflicting positions in order to reach an 
acceptable outcome.
(A) Areas of difference can and do frequently remain, and 
will perhaps be the subject of future negotiations, or 
indeed remain irreconcilable. In those instances in which 
the parties have highly antagonistic or polarised relations, 
the process is likely to be dominated by the exposition, 
very often in public, of the areas of conflict.
(B) In these and sometimes other forms of negotiation, 
negotiation serves functions other than reconciling 
conflicting interests. These will include delay, publicity, 
diverting attention or seeking intelligence about the other 
party and its negotiating position.
(C) Whatever the nature of the outcome, which may actually 
favour one party more than another, the purpose of 
negotiation is the identification of areas of common interest 
and conflict. In this sense, depending on the intentions of 
the parties, the areas of common interest may be clarified, 
refined and given negotiated form and substance.

Norms emerge in groups as a result of people conforming 
to the behavior of others. Thus, the start of a norm occurs 
when one person acts in a particular manner in a particular 
situation because she thinks she ought to.
(A) Thus, she may prescribe the behavior to them by uttering 
the norm statement in a prescriptive manner. Alternately, 
she may communicate that conformity is desired in other 
ways, such as by gesturing. In addition, she may threaten 
to sanction them for not behaving as she wishes. This will 
cause some to conform to her wishes and act as she acts.
(B) But some others will not need to have the behavior prescribed 
to them. They will observe the regularity of behavior and 
decide on their own that they ought to conform. They may do 
so for either rational or moral reasons.
(C) Others may then conform to this behavior for a number of 
reasons. The person who performed the initial action may 
think that others ought to behave as she behaves in 
situations of this sort. [3점]

Yes, some contests are seen as world class, such as 
identification of the Higgs particle or the development of 
high temperature superconductors.
Science is sometimes described as a winner-take-all contest, 
meaning that there are no rewards for being second or third. 
This is an extreme view of the nature of scientific contests. 
( ①) Even those who describe scientific contests in such a 
way note that it is a somewhat inaccurate description, given 
that replication and verification have social value and are 
common in science. ( ②) It is also inaccurate to the extent 
that it suggests that only a handful of contests exist. ( ③) But 
many other contests have multiple parts, and the number of 
such contests may be increasing. ( ④) By way of example, 
for many years it was thought that there would be “one” cure 
for cancer, but it is now realized that cancer takes multiple 
forms and that multiple approaches are needed to provide a 
cure. ( ⑤) There won’t be one winner ― there will be many.

At the next step in the argument, however, the analogy 
breaks down.
Misprints in a book or in any written message usually have a 
negative impact on the content, sometimes (literally) fatally. 
( ①) The displacement of a comma, for instance, may be a 
matter of life and death. ( ②) Similarly most mutations have 
harmful consequences for the organism in which they occur, 
meaning that they reduce its reproductive fitness. ( ③) 
Occasionally, however, a mutation may occur that increases 
the fitness of the organism, just as an accidental failure to 
reproduce the text of the first edition might provide more 
accurate or updated information. ( ④) A favorable mutation 
is going to be more heavily represented in the next generation, 
since the organism in which it occurred will have more offspring 
and mutations are transmitted to the offspring. ( ⑤) By 
contrast, there is no mechanism by which a book that 
accidentally corrects the mistakes of the first edition will tend 
to sell better. [3점]

Even those with average talent can produce notable work 
in the various sciences, so long as they do not try to embrace 
all of them at once. Instead, they should concentrate attention 
on one subject after another (that is, in different periods of 
time), although later work will weaken earlier attainments 
in the other spheres. This amounts to saying that the brain 
adapts to universal science in time but not in space. In fact, 
even those with great abilities proceed in this way. Thus, 
when we are astonished by someone with publications in 
different scientific fields, realize that each topic was 
explored during a specific period of time. Knowledge 
gained earlier certainly will not have disappeared from the 
mind of the author, but it will have become simplified by 
condensing into formulas or greatly abbreviated symbols. 
Thus, sufficient space remains for the perception and 
learning of new images on the cerebral blackboard.

One way to avoid contributing to overhyping a story would 
be to say nothing. However, that is not a realistic option for 
scientists who feel a strong sense of responsibility to inform 
the public and policymakers and/or to offer suggestions. 
Speaking with members of the media has (a) advantages in 
getting a message out and perhaps receiving favorable 
recognition, but it runs the risk of misinterpretations, the need 
for repeated clarifications, and entanglement in never-ending 
controversy. Hence, the decision of whether to speak with the 
media tends to be highly individualized. Decades ago, it 
was (b) unusual for Earth scientists to have results that were 
of interest to the media, and consequently few media contacts 
were expected or encouraged. In the 1970s, the few scientists 
who spoke frequently with the media were often (c) criticized 
by their fellow scientists for having done so. The situation 
now is quite different, as many scientists feel a responsibility 
to speak out because of the importance of global warming and 
related issues, and many reporters share these feelings. In 
addition, many scientists are finding that they (d) enjoy the 
media attention and the public recognition that comes with it. 
At the same time, other scientists continue to resist speaking 
with reporters, thereby preserving more time for their science 
and (e) running the risk of being misquoted and the other 
unpleasantries associated with media coverage.

Emma and Clara stood side by side on the beach road, with 
their eyes fixed on the boundless ocean. The breathtaking 
scene that surrounded them was beyond description. Just after 
sunrise, they finished their preparations for the bicycle ride 
along the beach road. Emma turned to Clara with a question, 
“Do you think this will be your favorite ride ever?” Clara’s 
face lit up with a bright smile as she nodded. “Definitely! 
(a) I can’t wait to ride while watching those beautiful waves!”
(B)
When they reached their destination, Emma and Clara 
stopped their bikes. Emma approached Clara, saying “Bicycle 
riding is unlike swimming, isn’t it?” Clara answered with a 
smile, “Quite similar, actually. Just like swimming, riding 
makes me feel truly alive.” She added, “It shows (b) me what 
it means to live while facing life’s tough challenges.” Emma 
nodded in agreement and suggested, “Your first beach bike 
ride was a great success. How about coming back next summer?” 
Clara replied with delight, “With (c) you, absolutely!”
(C)
Clara used to be a talented swimmer, but she had to give up 
her dream of becoming an Olympic medalist in swimming 
because of shoulder injuries. Yet she responded to the hardship 
in a constructive way. After years of hard training, she made 
an incredible recovery and found a new passion for bike 
riding. Emma saw how the painful past made her maturer and 
how it made (d) her stronger in the end. One hour later, Clara, 
riding ahead of Emma, turned back and shouted, “Look at the 
white cliff!”
(D)
Emma and Clara jumped on their bikes and started to pedal 
toward the white cliff where the beach road ended. Speeding 
up and enjoying the wide blue sea, Emma couldn’t hide her 
excitement and exclaimed, “Clara, the view is amazing!” 
Clara’s silence, however, seemed to say that she was lost in her 
thoughts. Emma understood the meaning of her silence. 
Watching Clara riding beside her, Emma thought about Clara’s 
past tragedy, which (e) she now seemed to have overcome.
